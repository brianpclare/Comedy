time opening up connecting in my
neighborhood saying hi to people and I
do have a gift though for seeming
awkward and I'm a little shy so
sometimes I don't say much and that
happened animate well so it was my
friend and her friends they didn't know
me all I said the whole night was I'm
wearing my rooster dress which it was uh
but they thought that I might be
developmentally disabled ah then I read
that people who are mentally retarded
often bring entire communities together
because they lack the social awareness
that makes loneliness possible we're so
stupid
so I am taking a page from that book of
lost at pictures going to my local cafe
and really being more myself hi
I watch your name you gotta hear me
hipster you got your earbuds in what's
your name Steve hi what is doing in your
laptop working something my Ben
plays music thief thief is a thief I
read a good book about hogs

myself a grande or half-and-half because
it is free and people begin to connect

crumbs from the bakery case yes Carmen

prostate surgery no he hasn't
yeah yeah uh I hope nobody here is
deeply religious if you are please just
rest in the glory that I am wrong uh I
am trying to be more spiritual I mean
more self-righteous get those confused I
I wish that science if there is a
science I would come up with a brain
ride where you could take a ride in
someone's brain and see all their
thoughts and their memories and their
feelings and why they do the things they
do and why they feel the way to you and
I know there's a low-tech version just
called listening I would like to believe
in something I've heard it is supposed
to feel good
so I imagine it feels like to believe in
God you know when you're in a
third-world shanty town at midnight
you're terrified but then off in the
distance you see the glowing logo of an
international conglomerate and you just
feel like for me maybe it's time I seek
the Exxon with it my mom uh says honey
whatever you think about all the time
that it's what you worship hmm
and the case like everyone to pop up in
the diet coke cans surround themselves
with obese house pets
turn to page 37 and the People
magazine's this Holy Scripture we read
the parable miss Kirsty hey what song
television then lost from pop culture
now welcome back into the zeitgeist
again and the worst-dressed shall be the
best dressed and the best friend shall
be the worst roost feel bad about that
that I worship celebrities but the mood
great weather of course I'm a tiny
frightened animal I'm going to look
towards most powerful and fertile
appearing of our species for information
on how to survive need to find out that
Jennifer Aniston is doing she's a strong
sexy monkey she's going to tell us where
all the bananas are located she was
quoted as saying I always say don't make
plans make options if you don't make
plans you make like shit look wise that
you don't it is that is a pretty big
piece of philosophical fruit I am going
to be nine on that rind a tablet of
poetry for at least a couple of years or
maybe I should be looking towards
professional actors for guidance
Hey um so uh yeah my mom believes that
you should always pray for people
because maybe God will do something for
them my sister believes that you should
never blast someone's energy unless they
know they're being blasted because what
if they want to die slowly of Lou
Gehrig's disease and you screw that all
up I believe this is all a cognitive be
you know distortion that HAARP helps
compartmentalize chaos anyway it's going
to be a great Christmas yeah ah a lot of
my friends do have religious beliefs and
I will question them
hey why that horrible thing happen earth
God's will
why that awesome thing happen this comes
well you just answer the same answer to
every question it just shows you didn't
study or maybe that's cars yeah are the
one answer they always say is a we can't
understand it it's a mystery God's just
so much smarter than us we can't figure
it out it's a mystery well that makes
sense uh cuz all God's mysteries start
with a horrendous murder with no
discernible wanted it was Mohammed in
Manhattan with a head
I long for the contentment and peace of
mind that religious and spiritual people
have but without all the hocus-pocus so
I've created a new God uh he's about the
size of this room he's served undulating
reptilian flesh and he just has a mouth
I can't understand what he's saying but
it's really working
my sister Sarah wouldn't you know is a
life coach and I have been trying to do
my best to challenge her with my
negative thoughts hey whirring that one
for me sure I'm wearing it too old to be
in show business Betty White
Dame Judi Dench Joan Rivers you're not
old enough hit me here I'll never be in
a loving committed relationship oh I
don't know past pets I'll go back I'll
go back okay fear this narrow you lose
everything including your mind except
the part of your mind that knows that
you lost everything
somehow you end up in the Philippines
walking the streets in Manila and a
bunch of bitchy filthy sweater remnants
a plug the one string banjo
no baggage hitting bottom as a
jumping-off point
what a gift hey Brent
why don't you juggle but being happy huh
challenge yourself okay I'm a house your
friends little seven cup or you might
ride shell joke about being happy
um so you know when you're filled with a
deep contentment and waves of joy you
cry and do I don't think it any better
but your self-esteem is so high that
shit is fuckin I did nice to be like you
please know the difference between right
and wrong then I moved to Los Angeles
and I lost 10 pounds cuz they take away
the food before you're done you're done
and stomach food for a month and a dozen
people came up to me and said you look
amazing
I know and who thought about help then
we'll be one we're dead I was at my
grandma's funeral and I was like thank
goodness it's open casket cuz you got
this girl
you finally got this
I uh my manager suggests it might be
time for me to get some Botox I said ah
I'm class still exploring my phrase
mm-hmm this is it's this no longer
relevant yeah but you know how it goes
um I used to be like you living in a
hippie cooperative going to sleep the
click clackety clack of a loom operated
by a man named ocean making an
ill-fitting wool hat later to be sold
for fair trade prices
I have protested every War Gulf War I
put what I thought were peace signs on
my face turned out to be the
mercedes-benz logo Oh
foreshadowing I asked for change on the
street while playing a musical
instrument poorly Oh Jay bunny
Tchaikovsky you got a dollar
sure
those cousins Owen Tchaikovsky why not
the one who's trying to buy their
classical music on the street you know
it goes um you uh you need health
benefits it helps you start working for
the man you noticed I was just typing
out what he had to say you know I felt
like I was taking back the night from
inside the machine because it makes a
difference to this starfish and then uh
you know you get a promotion you know my
ego says all I wanna be on TV and it
turns out the man owns that he's wants
to make you do a couple changes chair
joke so it's not to upset his buddies
slash corporate entities and I made
those changes and then the man said I'll
give you a big bag of money if you just
say exactly what I want you to say and I
deduct that big bag of money
now I'm redecorating my house in shades
of gray fuck the actual ethical oh yes
you continue being good a second
perfect
this is good cuz we're about to get dark
um I have a lot of anxiety I don't know
what yours feels like here's what mine
feels like you're at a party it's just a
regular fun party and then someone shows
up in a really pretty frightening ly
realistic gorilla costume except you can
see their eyeballs inside and you know
it's just fucking Steve Bennett quest
and everyone says oh yes Steve Bennett
was but he won't say he's Steve Bennett
quest and then he starts chasing you is
what I feel like all the time my um mom
has some anxiety she could not finally
in the house an object at rest stays at
rest I'm gonna corner curdled with my
bristles to the outside I'm asleep
somewhere she called my sister in a
panic and said Marie is disappeared and
I'm worried she's killed herself and I
have a hair appointment in town much
like our nation's airports my mama's
always at level orange and cannot
discern between a 12 ounce bottle of
shampoo and an explosive device Sarah I
would stretch the shallows for your
sister's body but we're outer
gingersnaps and your father loves ginger
snacks but he would never tell you girls
oh he would never tell you girl
anyone thinking suicide oh don't do it
people they so mad at you if you do that
they won't be so bad at you it's not the
season for it early spring most people
don't think of suicide during my
lifetime just in terms of oh the
stewardess will give me the whole can
oh-ho-oh turbulence I want to live I get
very passionate about this topic
ah there's over 7,000 US veterans die of
suicide every year which is funny
because I think they die over there but
they come home right it was all like
we're there paper whether over there
then like nobody that was the funny cuz
you almost take there are some people
they'll go for help is because there
still stigma because people don't talk
about mental illnesses the way they do
other illnesses apparently Steve has
cancer it's like fuck off
we all have cancer right I had cancer
pretty bad right now but I could
chemotherapy I get taken curve but I get
back to work ah yes didn't this chick
all this time apparently she let me know
she's been wearing contact lenses I said
well you know do what you need to do but
I don't believe in all that Western
medicine shit you know if you want to
see like other people it's all about
attitude you gotta want it
they think you would be able to stop
vomiting for me and the kids um no is I
myself
uh was for terrible time and uh started
having some plans some repetitively shit
ideas uh cuz the things were unbearable
oh I should kill myself I didn't know
myself budget then I realized wait a
minute
I've had a lot of repetitively shit
ideas I often thought it'd be a great
idea to buy day-old raisin bread in bulk
and then freeze it
I'm I'm also that many times
any a great idea to go on vacation with
my family you know my mortal enemies and
we'll fight them to the very last honey
we're going to Michigan it's gonna be
fun getting behind me soon it's with
your cousins we're going camping
I will not be dashed upon the rocks by
your siren song you know but you're
feeling bad so you start thinking a
little waste of space and I'm a burden
you forget that also describes the Grand
Canyon
watch out friends and family take
patient you from a safe distance revel
in your majestic profile oh but I owe
people a lot of money everybody hates me
hello Europe oh but I killed someone
so onion rings firecrackers busy shit oh
but I've got some other horrible
unforgivable us beautiful thing there's
79 billion of us now uh google it
someone has done exactly what you have
done or worse and is currently on a book
tour
as evidence of that I killed my best
friend by accident blossom the awesome
pug she would have forgiven me listen I
had a great life I died as a live nude
in a sunbathing with a light harness I
grew up in Berlin in the 30s you know we
could taste and shit on each other with
impunity was no big deal now you got a
dog park you left a leg of her puppies
up in arms you know but yeah I had I
shot you with my lady Beretta you know
the safety been off or something just
know that within six to eight hours and
it's been documented about bollocks I
would have eaten you sunny ways but I
typed in I killed my loved one into an
internet search engine and up came a
chat room where a woman ah
talked to me for an hour who had left
her baby in a hot car we're all doing
the best we can and sometimes it is not
that good this is a homeopathic remedy
for depressed y'all if you are feeling
terrible and you don't have insurance
here's what you do take a blue or black
pen you draw a rabbit space atop your
own face make some rabbit ears out of
paper plates cotton balls I don't know
what you have you make some fudge she's
very easy to make from what I have read
you go on your front porch open up your
window and you start yelling at people
hey jackass run to fetch they're pretty
letter so I said oh the guy sorry sorry
hi hi
it gets you out and about in your
community and it shows everyone that you
need help
oh yes it's cool I'll be back rich
we can't have the air conditioner on why
do you have other things on if you stay
alive for no reason at all please do it
for spite
there is a trend of people blaming
others when they're ill I have been uh I
think I'm a bit of a cold um that's
interesting you know whatever I was
stuffed up it's because I'm not letting
go stuff you know there's lot of stuff
that I'm not dealing with you're sick if
I'm sick it's like I'm sick of something
in my life all right that makes sense

tailbone you feeling bad

friend come visit me
in the hoosegow in a psych ward which
was a great thing that is amazing for
someone to come visit very grateful they
gave me a real talking to you know I
just feel like this place is so negative
it's kind of lot of negative energy I
know my brain is kind of going off like
an untethered jackhammer but I think I
know what you mean in terms of that sky
screaming into the wall I don't know he
seems to make sense sometimes too you
know what you need to do is get out into
nature you know get out in the woods
that's what I said like I could get
myself on a tree hey guys out there like
you don't like get into a cold body of
water just like float away right but
they took away my shoelaces whoo
I just talked to my spiritual advisor
and he said that people who commit
suicide
sometimes it's time for them to go that
they just need to move to the next
dimension I just I want to give you
permission and let you go okay uh you're
horrible and please come visit me
tomorrow and you're vulnerable please
come visit if you could bring me a 20
ounce diet coke is a lot of huh a lot of
cans uh can't want to bring that little
ray of sunshine over to the Children's
Hospital you wouldn't have to make a
wish
