did the teenage cancer gig last year
it's one at the Royal Albert Hall I've
done it before I did it 2006 but they
called again
and last year we're still ill you lasted
now it's a great gig and the teenagers
would count for getting free and
everything that the Thorg I am I'm done
they sit in the front row or lucky dog
and they get to come backstage
afterwards and meet me what tree that is
good for them so much better than going
to Disney World weather-wise could make
you sick if you in that state so meeting
me it's thumbs up so and I was doing the
pink this last time and I look down I
recognize one of them
I thought only eight came backstage two
years ago he would tell him about his
illness nice trying some stuff for him
and he said we just turned 18 and how
hard it was and I was thinking well that
was two years ago so now he must be
twenty saw the fucking beast and a
teenager lying little shit
he was lying about the camp though he
was riddled with it hurt him to laugh
but he shouldn't so I was doing the gig
and he was laughing along and I thought
yeah you laugh at my Alex fuming and it
got too much Mayo I recognized you when
you came backstage two years ago yeah
yeah you said you're 18 yes you're 20
now you have to get out and I called
security and they I struggled that he
was weak they worked out in Qatar later
although they have trouble getting older
to start with but then they say joy ever
made
they thought it is drip nearly at
someone's eye out
I like getting out the crowd started
booing I went here that they don't see
someone like you take the piss Abby off
you go
[Applause]
cheers everyone it's a big can of it I'm
not showing off I want you to know that
is a big can I'm not a dwarf but
ah I did a big-gun charity gig last year
for autism and like most people my only
experience of autism until recently was
Dustin Hoffman's brilliant portrayal in
Rain Man but I've just got this new
house in London and the neighbors were
coming round going on hi poking their
nose didn't basically but I thought you
know it'd be nice to UM for now when I
get a big gate they can fuck off and one
couple they've got an autistic son and
the mother was talking to me so this is
Douglas he's 17 and he never goes out
because you haven't got any friends so I
thought right okay this is well
concerned that you know I'm the rich
handsome man after Toby but I've also
got a heart of gold
and I said are take him out not really
went yeah so I went back on the Saturday
to and should always love to zoom and as
he was only about a mile from my new
house enhance two of it and so I'm
walking along the street with Douglas
okay and he doesn't take his eyes with
his mum all the way along
although out on the street like that and
his mum's in the doorway she's way of a
German she's crying right eventually she
shut the door when she goes indoors I
hailed a cab and said right take left to
the casino so
you gotta make it work for you so I
signed him in you had a little soot on
everything I thought this is going to be
brilliant okay
I went straight to blackjack table
that's their best one I don't know why
they said they're brilliant know that I
went okay dougie you know the school bet
- for good and one bad do you understand
he went yeah so I was about a thousand
pounds down in half an hour
Alan sorry out on Douglas do that thing
count the cards do that thing Tamlyn is
a good card come and tell me bit - for
good with join us and he went yeah Tosca
another thousand pounds down I thought
what saw was autistic so oh I was
confused I'll do some toothpicks on the
carp I said how many went I've been I
was did the second I can see the seven
for there one why did I get that one
so I took him back home and I said to
the mother there's been a mistake
he walked like Rain Man but he's got
none of that clever shit I know he's
wrong but I don't want to talk about if
I do do it all fall off the charity but
I think some causes are more worthy than
others joking aside obviously can the
very worthy cause
autism's are very worthy cause but I got
asked to a benefit gig recently for
sufferers of obesity but she went
sufferers of obesity I went do you mean
fat people she would know because
obesity is well she actually went no
because she was eating see we're sure no
just you know between snack right and uh

meat and gravy they complain and if
their own fault are on their famil I'll
look I'm getting fat oh all aeroplanes

me no they're not because if they were
we'd only get 12 fucking people on the
plane not fair it is fair that's what
does it and if we're talking about fair
ghosts and aeroplanes why is it I get
the same luggage amount of the guys 400
pounds with Roosevelt to carry on 32
kilograms to the plane oh no it used up
is 32 kilograms on his tip nah disease I
saw a documentary back in England about
this woman who was 350 pounds because
she ate ten burger and fries a day
that'll do it
10 separate meals of burger and fries 10
separate trip to McDonald's in a cab
Oh didn't even walk that why is it
calories okay so to story in these meals
they wires her jaw together so she
liquidized
ten burger and fries a day now she's on
burger smooth is now she's not even
chewing that used up three calories just
so lower behold she gets fatter so they
admitted her to have that thing done
where you staple your stomach together
and she's sitting there in austell
looking all depressed because I need for
now before an operation grunion
lank hair smock Christ knows where I got
that right
and he said it's a really dangerous
procedure but it's the only option left
whoa jogging you know you don't even
walk I'm salad is that like the choice
3:9 burger and fries a day to start it
to start where see we offer we have some
fat people in Britain but um you like

this going back okay he was going I
don't want a dad Gary I don't want to
die and I felt sorry for him
I thought over that but and I said how
much do you weigh and it anyways a
thousand pounds a thousand oh now my
point is this when he weighed himself
one day and he was say 500 pounds didn't
he think then that was a lot didn't he

essentially a land mammal that's a lot

isn't it
oh it comes that should be fun stuff I
[Applause]
was jogging one right with my ipod on
yeah looking good right
paparazzi got me full-page in the paper
the next day with a headline iPod
Shiki back anyway where was I oh yeah
all the charity work I do I don't wanna
really talk about it but I do one of the
first big charities I've got involved
with years ago was when I worked the
University of London was the Terrence
Higgins Trust which is the big AIDS
charity in them in Britain and it was
some it was sort of mid tonight ideas so
people are still like what did you think
old age was gone from strength to
strength now he's doing very well we've
gone global but quite don't die and
everything
first of December World AIDS Day I don't
think he'll ever take off like Christmas
because these guys got us wrong vibe
about it and the card companies are mid
Patrick they usually straight in for
anything online you can you can't you
cannot get sorry guys cards they don't
exist yeah or one that plays a little
tune to cheer coming up a little
relevant tune I know what relevant you
would be I'm a ninth down cowboy
it doesn't just mask but I won't do this
in San Francisco I am
because you had a bad day I'll shut up
no but I learned the fascinating fact
when working to the chariot ticket trust
people always learned stuff from my
lectures this is something true the
first HIV virus actually a combination
of two separate viruses that joined in
rhesus monkeys and made this rudimentary
form urbane and this was passed to
chimpanzees sometimes chimp to get a
bloodlust Anita rhesus monkey in it it
sort of evolved and mutated in chimp
because we're 98.6% genetically
identical to a chimpanzee it was able to
be passed to humans and the first human
contracted AIDS when he was chopping up
chimp meat and he cut his finger
although must excuse either given as
well you'd have to come up with summer
when you die and the doctor you guys
feel terrible doctor because I'm not
surprised you're the first human to
contract AIDS how would I got that two
ways
one you were fucking a chimp up the r-me
which no way honey
how else could I ask or I don't know you
could have been chopping up chimp meat
and create you think of that one shop
each impe finger thing but it went
slapped at the jungle found much him but
you fucking guys we aim I gave you what
you gave me aim I gave you a blowjob
sure I got eggs from you the way that I
guys from for meeting monkeys couldn't
eat monkeys you either eat them or
fucking them I was eating them but the
greatest thing I learned when working
for the ice cherry was that this is the
best leaflet in the world okay this is a
real flyer that came round issued by the
Terrence Higgins Trust okay
it came round the University I worked
out in about 1999 okay
and it was aimed at the last demographic
of gay men who still weren't taking
precautions they treated HIV like an
occupational hazard and there were
militant against the disease but they
wouldn't take precaution so it sounds at
last tiny demographic so it's very
hard-hitting the front cover is a bunch
of bananas with the word fuck I've been
and why I don't
and it's basically a 10-point plan of
the health advice to not contract HIV
and this is the this is the title of
this flyer you know it's going to be
good when this is the title okay ready
you know you don't always have to have
anal sex good to know in it think of an
old couple in a doctor's waiting room
looking through Reader's Digest and she
goes on what this you know you don't
always have to have anal sex see I
fucking told you okay and it's basically
10 suggestions of alternatives to that
neglect okay
I just read them to you number one okay
this is real okay number one why not
always start the same why not okay it's
a soft cell they're not pushing it on
your butt okay number one why not just
jack each other off
I've got the New Flyer Larry what does
it say well it's have a look shall we
just let's do one now okay no more up
the ask for our number one why not just
jack each other off on number two oh it
started so low mill both number two why
not just come on him back it's the
casual nature of it but like it's a
recipe why not just throw in an onion
[Applause]
we're doing the doctor hi doc drama game
Anna I mean no relationship but I'm
worried about the threat of HIV is there
anything I can do um just come on is
back
hahahaha
number three live the three oh so I used
to read yourself to everyone on math and
they'd be laughing number one and to get
them away girl number three why not just
come in his hair not the hair not the
hair on the back sure
on the back gone
[Applause]
on the back go on the back where we
fuckin ain't in that no star on the head
no no there there I don't trust you up
on a shower cap no the hair the Makah oh
okay
I have not before or since heard such
great use of the term eg as in this next
sentence number four why not try try so
that people can pick this really
difficult like just please ever go okay
this isn't brain surgery this next one
but they've put in try okay why not why
not try coming into some fruit eg

out what fruit is this simply as need to
be specifically for asses will right
they're not what for watermelon thank

ahead to number 10 okay because this may
be the greatest sentence ever written
I've included Shakespeare in this
thickens the office number thank you are

fun and educational I am trying to
educate myself more it reached that age
where I need knowledge I feel guilty
about not knowing enough you know I had
a good education but I can make the most
of it I think
and then I've even stopped watching
trash TV now when I'm at home I watch
hours and hours of Discovery Channel and
History Channel our Discovery Channel
History Channel ask me everything about
sharks and NASA's round of applause ever
there's not there not there not as far
as a lot of people make out um sharks I
mean
not is awful but shark brilliant amazing
creature
okay it can hone in on a floundering
fish right to the vibrations that it
picks up through electrical impulses
through sensors in its flank it doesn't
need his eyes but contrary to popular
belief they're either very good okay but
it can smell and taste the slightest
human secretion of blood and sweat one
part in a billion from a mile away a
shark would have found an Frank like
that not this rubbish I've been to
around its tiny
[Applause]
every day they went in okay let's move
on start
can we look upstairs today now if no one
down here move on Sarge what's that
so time to write a book for quite sight
when it ends a bit abruptly and no
sequel lazy no but not a traditional
subject for comedy the old Holocaust but
I will say something about the Holocaust
and I'm sticking my neck out here but in
my opinion I blame out off Hitler he was
the ringleader old are both that names
died out on it he killed that there good
news no one cool they're kids adults
nowadays no little adults going to
school those are Brad and Angelina's but
know that you don't need a peak to do in
the register Brad here Angelina here
adult here I do that quick time one can
take a picture of me doing that no but
people make excuses for him people say
oh he was stupid he was easily led
didn't he didn't mean that what you mean
didn't mean that as they all know is
influenced by the political philosopher
Friedrich Nietzsche right because
Nietzsche wrote this paper I'm talking
about a Superman he said not all men are
born equal
and Hitler misinterpreted this and when
way to fold it and I think of that
you're a great scholar you've done this
work and you get a call from the Fuhrer
and the fioor goes alright neat yeah
good what do you want me just read your
book what do you think love it
Louisville that man and superman not
everyone d call kill all the Jews sorry
[Applause]
not everyone Zeke also kill all the Jews
I didn't like that I read between the
lines I I didn't mean that terrible you
young Lincoln it yep y'all mean killing
Jewish people of you what are you
thinkin in Jewish people yeah a few how
many 6 p.m. 6 million that's all I won't
do any more leave it leave it at 6
that's terrible or do any more stay for
dinner well I will but be careful in
future I will are you write any other
books well I'm scared to tell you about
it I won't do anything what a new book
called my new book is called the gypsies
do we need it
Cheers now going to floor that shouldn't
we shouldn't talk about such things it's
not like we're in peacetime now is it
there's a little thing going on in a
country called Iraq which is not my
favorite war my favorite war is oh so
many and they've got a good for this
means um uh uh Falkland that's probably
the Falklands because we won that one
and uh it was great it was a gangster
Argentina yeah weird
go to war without Betina oh I okay fair
enough yeah the reason is my favourite
war is that it with a range war and what
that means is the Argentine guns could
fire nine kilometres the British guns
could fire 17 kilometers so we just
parked our ship ten kilometers away and
there's a falling into the sea and we
were shelling the shit out of them
it's the wall equivalent of holding a
midget armed length and East lady you'll
just kick him in the bollocks but
[Applause]
Vietnam best soundtrack second world war
best ending I had to be the end that was
a great finale you couldn't follow that
good people avoid well I got all atomic
energy ah oh it's bad the effects are
still being felt today but I ended a war
and that's good and it was discovered by
Einstein and he's a genius and it is
1903 paper he said that life could be
described as discrete bundles of
energies that when irradiated onto an
unstable but what maniac thinks like
that
really I'm not a doctor but I think
that's what turns to even Hawking's mad
too much pink engine I mean the universe
is expanding course it's being have you
heard was it you take a day off go for a
walk on a walk funny okay open a window
what if it Evi robot ordered on you love
that oh yeah greatest mind on the planet
you say all we should never go Stephen
Hawking oh he's a genius he's not a
genius he's pretentious born in Oxford
and talks about fake American accent
he is actually a hero of mine not my
greatest hero my greatest hero is Nelson
Mandela what a man isn't he incredible
man incarcerated for 25 years he was
released in 1990 not about 18 years now
and he hasn't reoffended I think he's
going straight which shows you prison
does work I learned a lot last year
about one of your great American heroes
Rosa Park it was the 200 year
celebration of the abolition of slavery
in Britain last year we were bit ahead
of you on that
but well done well done
but the abolition of slavery wasn't the
end of racism racism was still inherent
in society as late as a 15-6 in England
and America and it was this one incident
that sparked off the civil rights
movement a young black woman who rose
apart refused to give up her seat to a
white person on a bus it was the law but
she'd had enough and she was arrested
for that but then that law was changed
but she didn't stop there she started
sitting in those seats met the disabled
people
[Applause]
she talked the driver when the bus was
in motion did she have the correct
change ready did she follow ah some
people choose I'm not a political
comedian I used to be quite political
growing up that 1516 year I'll becoming
aware and wow you did it to annoy your
parents obviously but um I think we're
in a dated with politics from an early
age I think everything is charged with
politics and morality and the way to
live it's in everything fables Nursery
Rhymes little sayings I remember I must
finish young as sick when we used to
have an assembly at school an infant
school we'd all come in every Monday and
sit down on the floor cross-legged and
our deputy headmaster he's gone and tell
us a story and they always have a moral
that we were meant to think about and
this would make us into leaders of men
character building and he used to take
ages over it and he loved it with his
best day you know and I know he told us
about the two mice the lazy mouse and
the industrious Mouse and it was summer
and these two little mice were out in
the woods the Sun was out the streams
were babbling there was flowers there
were berries there are nuts
there was our and lazy Mouse he just be
running around in the Sun had a bite
from the berries throwing the rest away
there was lows it was never going to run
out
industrious Mouse he never very sure but
he'd eat it all and he put one away for
a colder season he news lazy Mouse he
wouldn t be working to learn about
sunbathing he that chili ice throwing
the rest away industrious moment Oh be
careful lazy Mouse because come with us
fuck off your square the fall comes same
sort of pattern
the last deberías is chewing they're
throwing the rest away it's just like
chili now is kicking through the leaves
you can't see him is if you saw the
leaves moving it it'd be under the
leaves basically you go what's that it's
lazy Mouse underneath it if you could go
under there like the Discovery Channel
you see lazy Mouse don't fuck it
industrious Mouse he's been putting
freeze drying those of berries be
chopping words and the inmate made an
axe to chop the word here out of a
little twig and a sliver of Flint and
she tied on with a horse hair thus
enabling him to sharpen stockpile fuel
so winter comes different pattern the
ground hard there's nothing there's no
fruit there's no berries there's no nuts

including his body wagon
of course industrious Mouse now he's in
his cottage but he built some Oh roaring
log fire to sit in there rock him on a
pebble knock at the door who's that
obviously so he goes over the door into
the door it's late enough and he goes
what do you want I'm cold I'm hungry
come with any food and think I'm going
to die here
well I did warn you didn't I because
yeah because never mind come in here and
share with me where's the moral there
fuck around do what you want and then
scrounge up a dugu that's a terrible
moral for children
oh he told us the one about the boy
cried wolf
have you heard that I wanna tell you
again boy in the Bible I don't know if
I'm aghast to think year alright alright
boy looking after the Sheep for the
villagers that's his job look after
those sheep boy you know I am but he
gets a bit bored probably isn't it
sleepy if he's counting them right and
he thinks oh kind of I like a laugh here
use wool wool and the birds just come up
and it'll where's the wall because if
they wolf I got them so next day its
board against that work the tree got
very little imagination you guys I'll do
that again
so he goes Wolf Wolf
where's the wolf says no wahoo you
through so next day it's in there there
really is a wolf and the wolf comes up
and he goes Wolf Wolf
whoa whoa but the villagers don't come
and the wolf eats all the Sheep and we
were told the moral of that is never
tell a lie now isn't the moral of that
is never tell the same lie twice okay
a terrible moral for children nursery
rhyme Jack and Jill went up the hill to
fetch a pail of water Jack fell down and
broke his crown which I later learned
met his cranium but always out fell off
and Jill came tumbling after
and that's a true fable of 16th century
lovers used to go after the well behind
the prying eyes of the villagers and
their spouses now their way and what's
the moral there don't fuck around with
slut sorry that your head caved in how
is that applicable to five-year-old I
have never worked out the moral to
Humpty Dumpty Humpty Dumpty sat on a
wall Humpty Dumpty had a great fall all
the king's horses and all the king's men
couldn't put Humpty together again
all I can think is don't sit on a wall
if you're an egg but again how is that
applicable to a five-year-old human
I mean you tell that to agree with the
five others so don't sit on a wall you
know would we need farming egg I'm not a
gun
Oh doesn't make sense in from it I win
none of us an X if there was an egg

I'm an edge I finally about nothing I
know he is now I don't know what the
fuck what don't I can't fucking hear I

I don't think you learn things so now I
don't think you learn things that sneaky
way through things that teachers and
parents I think your formative years are
your peers that's what you want to be
like when you're in adolescence you want
to be like you know the cool boy or the
older boy and luckily I went to school
where all the other boys were idiots and
one in particular was amazing he was
called David Beasley and I don't have a
politically correct term it was a
fucking moron
I actually face
Gareth from the office on him and that's
true so you could imagine yeah is that
the you very much oh thank you and we
were about 14 okay and this is sort of
thing used to come out with used to
believe anything that was idiotic
okay with confidence possible tales two
things he'd heard right okay so he came
in one through about 14 and he said
right it's amazing right when you get
captured by cannibals big problem

at a hormone when you're talking shit
j'avais unbelievable hear this do I
confess to us once Ireland but we were
in biology class and it was before the
lesson and he came in and he went ah

been in and left me some tea and
biscuits now he didn't have to tell us

the mother so the mother goes up the
stairs for the try he loved this to you

didn't involve him actually um it was
true because it made the local paper
words about this guy
we were about 14 15 so this is like
amazing news to us and this other guy
was notable I think it was by 17 and it
was a bit of a scandal because he got
prosecuted for lewd behavior and what
this bloke did he went down to the the
public toilet and he found one of those
dodgy toilets nice at there you know the
hole in the cubicle like the glory hole

toilet okay

hole to go in and out eventually someone
comes in Russells around a cop comes
through or is something off what you

one of them blab that around town then
stop blow winner hi honey I'm home
good day dear yeah saw Toby how was he
he was all right I will tell you one
story before I go
it is toilet-related when I am first
moved in with my girlfriend 20 odd years
ago our first apartment together with a
horrible place in the worst area in
London called Kings Cross Oh horrible
was a red-light district and it was a
seedy place it's all we could afford it
was one room okay but I'd like a little
kitchenette area so for our own sort of
sanity we moved the little single beds
into the kitchen bit so it's like a
one-bedroom apartment so anyway so at
night we're in a room this big okay the
bed's literally just fit in I had to
push it down the wall to get it in and
it came over the doorway about six
inches and in bed I could open the
fridge door the fridge was there the
cooker was there and the sink was there
there was no toilet the toilet was a
shared toilet with all the other
apartments in the block and it was two
floors down so what winds in the middle
of the night when I need a way putting
on trousers and going outside I'll just
pop into the sink
that one and I remember Jane 20 odd
years ago in a sleepy state saying I'll
at least take the dishes out first I
didn't know you go to the bottom plate
lift them all up and wheel straight out
the clutter
