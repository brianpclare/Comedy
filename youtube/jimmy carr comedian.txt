your mum's they're hard-working decent
women your monsters me a tenner I'm
joking
O'Hara Tina I'm your real dad giving no
one knows who your real that thousand
your mom Meredith
[Laughter]
this is awkward
she's brilliant Benji
well sorry I can't remember what that's
the thing that annoys you
[Laughter]
well the fact about that to a man
even remember fucking my mom
well thankfully you all seem to be
laughing you all seem to have taken that
quite well what's your name
Julie Oh
how did you know you were having a gay
[Laughter]
what were you thinking as you gave birth
even though I hope he's a little better
tell him Julia
[Laughter]
is that your girlfriend no beard it's
all about the core well done it's almost
like you're protesting too much
so are you clearly getting a bit of a
hard time but you know you've got your
smiling throat because of a comedy gig
you're expecting people to be a bit you
know it's a little bit of banter you may
be one expecting that looking a bit of
bad the problem comes when you do this
for six or seven days in a row and then
you find yourself
back in the real world doing something a
bit mundane on a Monday morning I don't
know maybe buying stamps at the post
office and there's a bit of cheeky
banter between you and the lady behind
the plexiglass so you want TV on Friday
night
did you what do you think
don't cry okay
I saw a proper scientific survey it said
that women can tell if a man wants a
baby just by looking at the shape of his
face presumably if it's like this that
means he doesn't want a baby and if it's
like this it means the conception will
involve a turkey baster that was my gay
face was that not clear enough fine have
it your way
sorry I'd like to apologize for that my
my I neglected the balls I saw a thing
in the paper about animal rights
protesters being up in arms because
guinea pigs were being used in testing
I thought the clue there is in the name
they're not calling them guinea pigs for
nothing that's what they're for I was in
the cinema last week with a friend he
turned to me he said I'm just going to
begins do you want anything
secure bring us back some peace thanks
very much
maybe one of those little minty things
from your island you know they're called
urinal cakes there's a disappointing
birth she get me okay he's not your
favorite the fog sign on the motorway
how pointless is that who's it for
people driving along thinking fuck I'll
see if I can big I wonder if I got
cataracts
is for my life
do you all do the same thing as me when
you drive normally you drive like that
yeah that's the normal driving position
a little bit of fog you've got you just
in case the fog using the car
[Laughter]
well what I'd like to do now ladies
gentlemen is tell you what this show is
actually about I've had an extraordinary
12 months I've had a life-changing
experience I was a very cynical man and
I didn't really have any religion in my
life and I've I've let spirituality in
in the last 12 months it's been
extraordinary so this evening what I
really like to do is to test
I'm joking there's no God grow up unless
of course you're Muslim in which case
there definitely is a God I'm not a
fucking idiot
[Laughter]
seriously I don't mind upsetting the
Church of England who are they gonna do
hold the fates
[Laughter]
I'm sure there are Christians out there
in the audience now thinking if I get
hold of that Jimmy car I'm gonna bloody
well forgive him creationists the
right-wing Christians creationists
believe every word Genesis says I don't
even think Phil Collins is a good
promise people with Tourette's what
makes him tick that was originally about
suicide bombers I've toned it down for
you if you were to count up every hotdog
sold outside football grounds in Britain
on any given Saturday chances are you're
autistic
well I feel we've warmed up let's try
some properly offensive jokes see how we
get a lot
99% of women kiss with our eyes closed
which is why it's so difficult to
identify rapists
let's have a little time out there
and discussed the rules of the game
feed-line
punchline I'll take care of that and
then you can either laughs you can laugh
and applaud I'll be flattered and
delighted or you can go war in a
disapproving stylee what you can't do is
laugh applaud than round ago
let's give it a go I saw a headline in
the Evening Standard it said football
rapists quiz was that story or a
competition
does anyone know do you know what you
meant to do if you're stung by a
jellyfish yeah piss on it women it's
exactly the right answer I didn't know
him I got told everyone told me I wasn't
on holiday everyone time we could get
stung by jellyfish you meant to pee on
it yeah I'll tell you this much it
doesn't work as well on shark bites the
boys family will live
[Laughter]
opponent he wants to been dead for a
couple of hours there was very little
no amount of Pacey's bringing him back
it is true urine can be used to
disinfect a wound it's it's often taken
the wrong way that's why I no longer
work with us in Johns Ambulance come
here laughs that looks nasty
he's apparently not what anyone wants to
see on that same subject I've got a
little time-saving tip for the gentleman
in the room I don't wash my hands after
I pee what I do is I wash my cock in the
morning then I'm good for the day
sometimes it's the best bit of my day
I am very thorough do you know you meant
to do if you're attacked by a bear does
anyone know
[Laughter]
I have a feeling that might be quite
involuntary
that sounds like advice given by a
forest ranger trying to kind of go well
no that's the procedure
I saw the bear coming at me I thought
[Music]
you could try and piss on it although I
think if you whipped it out in front of
their everything on older any other
suggestions as to what to do if your
time by bear make yourself big yes make
yourself big go and grab something to
eat
work out a little maybe buying one of
those puffy jackets get back to the bear
as soon as you possibly can
you mean go like that
you're like an advert for natural
selection there's a bear coming at us
don't worry I'll handle this
[Laughter]
I imagine the berry thing although
monstermunch
and hello novelty food any other
suggestions as to what to do if you're
tapped by about play dead is exactly the
right answer do you know why you meant
to play dead
sticky used to how you're gonna be in a
minute just so there's less mess a snake
bite isn't gonna kill you unless of
course you're allowed you to cider
that's a joke for the Goths think about
it they're the ones that need cheering
up
I love swearing I've always quite sorry
what's that I missed a bit of chat it's
not the tele if you talk I can hear
now you're looking pissed off you're
thinking I didn't press the red button
it's called only interactive
[Laughter]
what were you saying I thought you were
talking about snake bite the drink
well what happened well
okay in a joke joke is like two stories
yeah
and the first story makes you make an
assumption about something so the
assumption people made about snakebite
in in that joke was that it was a snake
biting you the jokes you made the
assumption he's talking about a snake
bite a snake biting someone in the
second part of the joke often known as
the punchline what you'll what you'll
find is that Rob will be will be whipped
from under you and you'll realize that
the assumption you made was erroneous
suddenly revealing a fact that was
previously concealed is the nature of
all one-liners batam so in essence I was
talking about both snake bites the thing
that happens when I say quite soon
[Laughter]
sake it's nice to have you here the sea
because I think one of the charity gigs
I did help pay for the minibus that
brought you here
nice to see that money wasn't wasted
Oh bless a little heart what are you
making of the rest of the show are you
just enjoying the spangly thing
[Laughter]
I've always liked swearing I'm a big fan
of throwing especially sort of
middle-class polite swearing the sort of
swearing parents do in front of the kids
to pretend they don't swear terms like
effing we all know it means fucking it's
a nice way of saying it is now I've got
a story about this sort of wedding with
my friend Craig he's Scottish he swears
a lot yeah I don't need to say both of
those things anyway we're all suited and
booted at this very posh wedding on our
very best behavior he leans across the
table he says pardon my french I thought
were in trouble here no you don't speak
French you barely speak English it says
pardon my french but we all know Paul is
an effing cunt
[Laughter]
that's the bit of the sentence that
needed cleaning up there
I tell you what I think we're shit out
as a nation
I think we're terrible at languages
would you agree with that being the
British are terrible at languages and I
think that's why at one stage we had an
empire
I think our arrogance gots an empire
because well you know we've got sailing
ships and we went off around the world
trying to find stuff to bring back to
show off that's what you do on your
holidays we arrived on the shores of a
foreign land we got out there both we
said I've had to buy some spices please
I'm getting nothing here Jeremy said a
bit louder much more I'd like to buy
some spices please still nothing well
I'll fetch the muskets we'll build a
railway in 200 years there came a call
center
very much an abridged version of Empire
but that's what happened
we've got another story about how bad we
are at languages I was doing a bit of
material last year about the rioting all
over Paris French people rioting it's
funny quick the air they have a water
cannon if we're not careful we'll be
washed
[Laughter]
and I wanted to check ahead and offended
anyone so I said is there any French
people in someone shouted si Senor
well that's a new kind of stupid
is expanding
[Laughter]
my favorite story of the last year
concerned an Oxford student he was
walking home late one night and he
sexually harassed a police force not
even my favorite story ever but he was
he was walking home late one night and
he called the police horse gay that was
his crime now if ever there was a
victimless crime that's it calling a
police horse gay for a start there's
nothing the matter with being gay
secondly it's a horse it can't
understand birdie even if by some
miracle it could understand I think the
horse would be okay with being called
gay because I think a horse be fairly
sexually self-confident I mean for a
start it's hung like itself but the
policeman didn't let it go no he got off
the horse he arrested the young man took
liver cells overnight in the end he was
fined 70 pounds through the courts for
calling a police horse gay I wish I'd
been his lawyer I would have got him off
because in his defense the horse was
standing naked on all fours in the
middle of the street
[Laughter]
with a uniform man on his back bass
quite
you'll go right come on you're so far in
the closet you have an adventures in
Narnia
[Laughter]
don't get the wrong idea I thoroughly
approve it's a lifestyle choice but
wrong choice
no but if God didn't approve of
homosexuality he would have sent some
sort of plague to wipe them out
Oh easy if anyone's offended can I refer
you to my earlier comments were said I
don't believe in God and then
respectfully request you fuck off it's
only a joke jokes are fine proper
homophobia isn't fine I don't like it
when the tabloids are homophobic because
there's such an important part of our
culture the tabloids when they get it
wrong it sends a very bad message do you
remember last year when they outed a
footballer which is a terrible thing to
do anyway they outed this footballer and
in the course of the article where they
outed this guy's are homosexual they
described consensual oral sex between
two adults here
two fellas sucking each other off they
described that as a prank how demeaning
to homosexual sister to have that act of
lovemaking described as a prank and it
also doesn't work from the other point
of view because I like to think of
myself as something of a prankster
but I don't think I've ever said
yeah
[Laughter]
don't forget the balls that's you you
really do care what about you from sir
you're from New York what are you doing
over here do you mind me asking you do
something you moved here for work
what sort of work do you do I mean I'm
not suggesting I need to see your papers
but what are you bringing to the party I
know it's an idea company thing what man
is that cash points
[Laughter]
you looking at 80s
it's our language you fucking read it
[Laughter]
yeah next time you have a fight with
someone stop get involved
[Laughter]
they go on you can sorry if it wasn't
for you we'd be speaking German how
little do you know about our language
abilities
there's no way we'd have picked it up in
60 years
[Laughter]
one area of life where comedy lets me
down all the time is greeting cards I
love sending cards to people but I can
never think of anything funny to write
in them so I thought well I'm a
professional comedian I'll sit down and
give it some time and some effort come
up with some things you could put in
cars so you know might help out next
time you're in that spot
life is pain misery and suffering an
inevitable march towards death happy
fifth birthday cake
[Music]
by the time you read the end of this
sentence you'll have forgotten the first
half but what the hell have a great 87th
grandma office cards are difficult
leaving cards especially you know when
you have to all sign it everyone in the
office what do you write especially if
you don't know the person obviously it
doesn't matter cuz you're never gonna
see the fucker again so here's what I'd
recommend we never really had a chance
to get to know one another but I've
always noticed you in the office and I
just have a feeling we'd get on together
how about a drink sometime maybe dinner
who knows where it might lead good luck
with the baby obviously the worst kind
of card you can come across in everyday
life is the whip-round card it's a
fucking nightmare that would a big
envelope comes with a change in the
bottom who starts it no one likes I've
got a theory it's the person who the
whip around this fall it's a whip around
for Jimmy thought you were Jimmy here's
what I think you should write in the
next whip round card you don't know me
but I got bullied into putting five
pounds in your collection because I
didn't have any change and people were
watching
[Laughter]
for what it's worth this is my favorite
thing that I've ever written in a cart
no one wants to die alone tied up in a
shed having been tortured for days so be
my Valentine
anonymity is key to the success about it
Valentine's is easy all you need to do
is get a card with a couple of hearts on
it and go for the traditional message I
tend to go for the you know the really
old-fashioned sentiment I love you there
I said it now will you please let me do
up the bomb
I start a conversation great all the
times it's weird is it because it's the
one day of the year where you get
anonymous mail from a stranger saying
I'd like to fuck you and you go oh any
other day that's stalking and I found
that out the hard way
get well soon get well soon cards are
difficult because it says it all on the
front doesn't it get well soon that's
all you want to say so you know what you
write inside is wide suggest or your
wife will start looking elsewhere
motivation
what about one get-well-soon it's not
appropriate yeah I've got a friend he's
quite seriously or getting well soon
would be miraculous getting well at all
we're told is a long shot but there was
nothing for me in the card shop I had to
make my own card in the end I went with
die with dignity
he's a funny guy I think you'll see the
funny side and if he doesn't it's not as
if I have to avoid him for long
world's best dad if you want to see your
kids again lead 10,000 pounds in the
bins around the back
congratulations on your results negative
at all
[Laughter]
good luck in your exam
I'm sure it's benign I know you think
that's offensive but it's not when you
compare it to this
I know nothing's happened yet it's a
card on the front there is a girl
throwing her hair back clearly having a
brilliant time she's 16 it just says
you're 16 and then inside I've written
but it's still our little secret lots of
love dad
congratulations you're 18 stone nearly
your target weight
I'm having to do a lot of baby cards
recently because a lot of my friends are
having babies and you've got to do the
card for when the baby arrives but also
the one when they find out they're
pregnant so you're having a baby
thank you thought to that I thought
you've been getting fat you're having a
baby and that's final
yours the Catholic Church
all they're sticklers for that kind of
thing it's a girl better luck next time
lots of love the Chinese

[Laughter]
have you ever looked at a bill in a
restaurant where it says service no
included and thought nah wasn't was it I
was staying in a hotel last week er came
down for breakfast I said I'll have a
continental breakfast as is my want the
waiter said to me what room you in said
it's the dime
sex is always barren hotels have you
notice that ladies sex is always bear in
hotels why is that
is it because with a hooker
is you don't have to watering is you
know the clean the sheets
oh you fucking her
there's a hole maybe later
oh I see the bomb sakes going on
Lester I always think you know you're
doing something bad sexually bad in a
good way when you think we better put a
towel down before that happens I think
you always know we're doing something a
bit experimental yeah we've had just
cover that first I've never done this
before it could end badly
I don't even know if you're gonna make
it through but good luck laughs do you
think strippers get home after a hard
day undressing and think
[Laughter]
I realize that's the worst mine with the
stripper is it
I'd love to go to a strip club where
they just went lower that's my vagina my
bitches
I've discovered incidentally the worst
thing you can say when a stripper is
performing I was at my friend Toby stag
do and we booked a stripper but she felt
through on the day because she was
unwell so the agency sent us a
replacement anyway there's 20 of us in
the basement of a restaurant in West
London watching this girl do some fairly
grisly things which I will come to later
and Lee turned to Harvey and he
whispered and I don't know where he
learned to whisper I'm guessing in a
fucking helicopter
as we all are
you went yeah I heard the fit one let us
down
they echoed round the room that's how
big her vagina was
she was doing some fairly horrible
things she she's doing a thing with a
bottle I was disgusted red wine with
fish
I once went out with a girl who was so
fat it felt like I was two-timing her
I'm joking that ingo our villa
the big problem they talk about these
days is childhood obesity they talk
about about all the time childhood
obesity and they say these kids are
greedy they're not greedy they've just
got slow metabolisms and very fast cheap
eating hands there are 1 million obese
children in Britain today do you realize
if they all jumped up and down at the
same time they might lose a little bit
of fucking weight I worried that these
are beast children are sending a very
mixed message to our pedophiles
so very easy to catch
who wants to fiddle with a fancy
the sex offenders register I'm not even
sure they should be in school
[Laughter]
screaming in bed ladies that's all very
well screaming in bed fine express
yourself but why does it always have to
be the same thing
ah you're on my hair well maybe if
you've got a Brazilian this wouldn't
buying presents for minutes and
nightmares they are thought called these
flowers again are hardly chocolates
again I'll go for a lingerie mom was
livid men think about sex every 7
seconds which I think makes to India dad
creepy
people say the books always better than
the film and the books always better
than the film I don't agree with I can
think of loads of film so much better
than the book
cum guzzling sluts I must have seen that
film a hundred times
[Laughter]
applauding that you Jewish and easy size
isn't important it's what you do with it
would you agree with our ladies
[Music]
lady over there that likes a big copy
she doesn't care
[Laughter]
it's quite possible you just whispered
and they picked up an echo
I've just I've just always thought that
such a retarded expression size is
important it's what you do with it when
I was fine you pop it in your mouth and
your vagina how's that gonna be a total
waste of time
I like it when ladies get tattoos have
any ladies in here got tattoos what have
you got and what you've got a valence I
think that may be the crudest term I've
ever heard for a vagina
I've got a vent on a few particularly
gassy I suppose whereabouts is this vent
on your arm you've got event you you had
by all accounts got some sort of vent
fucking go girl
nothing says feminine like air
conditioning equipment nothing says I'm
hot like I need a fucking vent that's
how hot I fucking out see we'll got one
on the small of their back why have you
got a football symbol what sorry yes I
would so look football symbol what is it
it's Gaelic football right now I know
what gaining focus how come you've got
back there did you do the whole team
you've got a bonus
he's always from me it's a lovely place
to get a tattoo because it's discreet
when you asked a lot of ladies why they
get a tattoo they they they say I got
one there because it's just for me in my
partner all partners it's you know but
my question is if he's looking at that
he's already having a good time the last
thing he needs is more visual stimulus
what you've basically got on your lower
back is a target
having said that I really like that is
there some trying to convince my
girlfriend to get one I want her to
either get if you can read this you're
fucking me
or now wash your hands I'd like to get a
tattoo I'm thinking about getting one
just there just across there just above
the speed I was just above the
bananahammock saying caution choking
hazard age is 16
may contain nuts
[Laughter]
one in three people fantasize about
group sex three and one people is group
sex
[Laughter]
I'm not in favor of all kinds of group
sex I'm not in favor of the two guys one
girl threesome for the very simple
reason I never want to see another man's
happy face because women when they
orgasm look beautiful and serene full of
life I've seen it in magazines and films
but men when they orgasm look as if
they're drinking vinegar through their
eyes
[Laughter]
well has anyone been involved in that
kind of capers anyone have the two guys
one girl threesome have you been
involved in that kind of caper sir you
know willing to say what was it three
fellas was it
[Laughter]
your brothers
what doing what happened so forth tell
us you started drinking and it just
happened
you got hammered did you what the guy
missed
I'm looking at you sir what I'm guessing
you've never been with a woman but you
made up a story
[Laughter]
I just my question is I don't know what
the f-ck would be you know because do
you change ends at half time I think it
would take more willpower than I have
not to high-five the other fella
nice work I think you'd be gentleman you
would change ends because you know she's
not enough to be thinking about I can't
even do that
[Laughter]
I saw a thing in the paper a couple of
months ago it said if you're filling in
an application form these days trying to
apply for a job or maybe applying for
university something like that anything
we have to fill in a form they don't
care about your qualifications as much
what they want is someone with a bit of
a sense of humor I thought what I could
help but now I think it's a funny thing
she could put in forms might help
someone out is anyone applying for a job
or anything like that or what are you
applying for to be a teacher
oh my very thing recently that said that
the best teachers the ones that graduate
very top of teacher training go and
teaches special needs schools I could
not thinking he's waste
what are they gonna get a better
standard of potato painting
well this might help if you're getting
your CV together you never know
educational qualifications you've got to
kick off without the CV I went to
boarding school I was a day boy at least
I think that's what they were shouting
I got a double first at Cambridge first
person to get their balls out in choir
practice
first person to be hospitalised by a
chaplain personal statement that's an
annoying thing you've got to do a
personal statement now you've already
filled in a CV and an application form
and then they make you write a little
essay about yourself at the end it's
rubbish here's my personal statement you
can borrow if you like I've got tiny
balls balls like marbles is that enough
I shave them there I said ease
what do you expect the position you've
applied for to involve in this meetings
a few months of keeping my head down a
part of the boss at the Christmas party
had from conceptual dalliance with a
colleague some sort of harassment
tribunal Paula buys with departure
little bit of realism there a little bit
of truth for you I applied to be in the
police any policeman in undercover I say
well they've got a great form be the
police what's your greatest personal
achievement to date they asked I've said
I've stolen over sixteen thousand pounds
worth of stationery without once getting
caught what I used to do is I used to
take all the post-it notes and pens and
pads and ink cartridges and laptops stop
you're gonna Nick anyway
it's just like instead of nicking it in
my bag or my coat what used to do is go
and stuff put it in a box yeah and then
when it was full take it to the post
room and have them deliver it to my
house it's fucking brilliant because not
only did you get the stuff you were
gonna steal anyway you also got kind of
a Christmas morning surprise two days
later a package for me who could have
been so kind
who's me what do you consider your
greatest weakness I demand too much of
myself and others either that oh how
much alcohol do you consume over a
seven-day period
how do you possibly expect me to
remember I mean last month as did the
two-for-one on Malibu I lost a fortnight
have you ever misused any illegal
substances yes I once accidentally
snorted heroin thinking it was cocaine
our breasts to be honest this is a sad
state of affairs but this is the last
question on the police forum are you all
racist or have you ever been a member of
the BNP I've said no but I'm a fast
learner and I'll do anything to get this
job
we all saw that documentary I applied to
what did Starbucks the posh coffee shop
because I'm in there every day anyway I
thought I might as well do you enjoy
working as part of a team they asked
I've said absolutely I very much enjoyed
the workplace team dynamic it's easier
to get away with stuff plus there are
those long lunches and the team-building
weekend's where you get to make a raft
and finger each other and that
when was the last time you received a
great customer service and why was it so
memorable I was with a wonderful
prostitute the other night seriously she
had a vagina like a mouse's ear
I imagine that would meet you could hear
you coming sorry where did you hear
about this role you can't just say Steve
told me you've got to dress it up a bit
so here's here's my version feel free to
use it if you need well I just returned
from teaching the Harvard MBA my wife
Scarlett Johansson and I were
entertaining our good friend professor
Stephen Hawking who would come to ask my
advice on his latest theory concerning
the evolution of the universe he and I
were in the library browsing through my
most recent translation of Etruscan
hymns into middle Flemish when he said
I'll never forget this he said to me
there's a job going at Starbucks and I
think you'd be perfect
only he said it in his hilarious Dalek
voice
I applied to be in the fire chefs have
got very good form by our small skills
do you think he possessed me you could
bring to the fire service I said I'm
good at playing pool sitting on my fat
ass collecting for comic relief and
plumbing if anything I'm overqualified
I realize if my house burns down they'll
bring marshmallows that's fine they also
ask what's your greatest personal
achievement to date I've said when I was
14 I just vanished at the very tip of my
wink

moment unless of course you succeeded in
which goes well done well we have all
tried ladies

sociological experiment gentlemen if you

example of when you've used initiative

tattooed blokes one of the men was
knocked on the pavement unconscious I
seized the opportunity and kicked him in
the face
in case you didn't like that I've got
another version for you I got ID made up
saying I'm from the gas board it's not
very convincing but then pensioners

can't see the ideas fake that if she
really need a telly
describe yourself in three words smart
dynamic intelligent attentive
do you have any special needs I asked
this on quite a lot of forms so do you
have any special needs I've written back

I've got a lower grown-up to do and last
one how long is your notice period
I usually notice stuff almost
immediately

the toilets busy do you think that
bullshit will piss in the sink of it's
nearer train toilets are disgusting
I wrote to complain by styro to complain
our scrool that this is disgusting
on the mirror in shit but the sentiment
was there and that the important home
I don't know if anyone else has got this
but my girlfriend tells me about her day
in real time
sex can get monotonous within a
relationship same person every month I
remember the first girl I ever held you
never forget your first hostage I'll
tell you what's embarrassing getting
your cock stuck in the flies of another
man's prowess
could you move around a bit okay
I think you're encouraging the others
what's your name I better ask Joan hello
Gemma he's the only card she could just
pop the Chinese models out for a minute
[Laughter]
you seem to be teetering on the edge of
orgasm at all times I've seen it in
films I know what do you do Chema you're
a cheerleading coach the easiest job in
the world I think if I'm not mistaken
there's a new name for cheerleading
coach though isn't there that we call it
grooming now
[Laughter]

for you have a squad for the what's the
fury jams is there a term for
menstruation
there's a cheerleading squad called the
fury jams
a few regions
and you teach people to cheerlead he
said these are grown adults 10 to 16 oh
can you get them to I'm pretty sure is
showering there's more showering than
you would imagine
has anyone else Donnie cheerleading DVDs
[Music]
I'm something of a connoisseur
a collection and mainly they like to get
sudsy let's move this along but lovely
lovely to meet you with your hilarious
laugh it's infectious I like it thanks
very much for coming thanks and thanks
very much for Cheerilee me thank you for
helping our young people it's valuable
work you do
[Laughter]
I've got a little tip for you if you
can't stop by the police in the car and
they they do the usual thing of getting
you to wind down your window and say
excuse me sir do you do you know what we
stopped you don't say they are did you
forget
they fucking hate that I'm actually a
very good driver last year I got 25
points my maths teacher always used to
say show you working out so in maths I'd
always wear a vest my best friend at
school was asthmatic for a laughy's to
hide his ventolin inhaler wheeze I had a
friend they used to self-harm because he
was bullied I used to think oh so do you
wrong
I tell you I blame for all the drugs in
schools the supply teachers are there
any Goths in today Bengali Goths no
Goths in the audience oh there's one got
there hello Gulf how are you I'm loving
the goth don't get the wrong idea
it's just whenever I see a goth walking
down the street I don't see one person I
see two disappointed parents the kid he
used to be such a lovely boy now he
looks like a slutty girl I think young
people some young people do have genuine
problems some young people have got
terrible skin I had a pizza delivered
last week I thought the guy's face was a
special promotion in fairness it did
look delicious
it's all cheesy and bubbly and whatnot
if you do have bad skin look on the
positive side it's nature's own condom
school exams are a lot easier these days
yeah lot easier than when I was in
school
apart from history class got harder all
things have happened when I was at
school when I was 17 my mate Anthony on
his 17th birthday brought in a 125cc
motorbike he thought he was the dog's
bollocks he came in we all went it's
really dangerous man just be careful on
that yeah he went yeah dangerous
whatever think about how many birds I
can pick up with this I thought well
unless you join a stunt team
there's a thin line between neighborhood
watch and becoming a vigilante and it's
a line you cross when you buy a cape
do you know there's now a warning on
superhero costumes if you buy a
superhero costume it says on it this
costume does not give you special powers
all indeed the right to see your
children
kids say the funniest things please
don't no mommy
she's already dead
are there any mum's in by shouting out
who's a mum proper ones not just once
they've done it together flat
I'm kidding we all love mums you know
mums are great they're the great unsung
heroes of our society they do so much
for so little what a moms ever get all
they ever get is you know not even a
thank you just Mother's Day Mother's Day
snobbish is there a Toblerone from the
garage or some flowers from a lamppost
me
I think it's alright to give your mom
flowers you've taken from a lamppost
where there's been an accident because
if you think about it you wouldn't do
that if she brought you up a little bit
better it's her fault of course one of
the major supermarkets is trying to
redress the balance yeah there's just
Mother's Day for moms but they've
decided to have a mom of the Year
competition mom of the year to sort of
you know just reward ordinary everyday
mums acknowledged you know all the good
work moms do anything I would question
about their charitable endeavor is the
massive banners they put outside every
one of their superstore saying enter
your mum today
I mean fair enough if she's up and out
she deserves something might I suggest a
call from Social Services
sugary tea was my mom's cure for
everything her like elixir of life if
you had any kind of problem emotional
physical financial it wouldn't matter
she would say come in
I'll make you a nice sweet cup of tea
which was fine until we found out my
brother was diabetic being diabetic so
pain in the Oscars it's sort of a
mid-range illness isn't it it's not a
cold it's a bit more serious than that
but it's unlikely to kill you and it
won't get you into the paralympics range
you've got a really search for the
positives with the mid-range things of
course the positive thing about being
diabetic is of course you can kill
yourself with sweets I'm going to end it
all pass the sugar dip dabs and there
might just cheer up enough not to
fucking bother I've got a half brother
say mom and dad but he's a macro don't
I had a run-in with a transsexual not
your classic you know I went to
Amsterdam and I met someone in the bar
and one thing led to another and we
ended up back at the hotel and you know
had a few drinks paid no I know what
happened was this
this transsexual this person that used
to be a man and is now a woman came to
help us out on a show she's doing a
little bit for us in the TV show and
then she had done a brilliant job
surgically I mean she looked like a
woman she looked brilliantly like a
woman but I think if you were born a man
there's certain things she will always
maintain a certain masculine place you
will always have even if they whatever
the surgeons do and she came into the
green room where we're all hanging out
before the show very demure Lee in in
high heels and said excuse me where's
the powder room I said you can't miss
it's just down there on the right she
said oh thank you very much freedom you
only taught it out on heels just as she
was leaving the room she took the paper
put it on wrong
most local thing in the world about a
big lunch Amara massive sheets
well what I'd like to do now ladies
gentlemen is help you I'd like to become
an agony aunt and to that end I went and
looked in lots of magazines
I've been a ghanaian column they're all
genuine letters these and I went through
and I thought what could I do better
agony aunt answers then there I cannae
arms and I think in many of the cases
yes I bloody can so I'll take you
through some examples so then maybe you
could share with me some of your
problems and I will do my best to sort
them out of course so all you've got to
be to be an acting the artist is
considerate and caring compassionate my
boyfriend loses his erection as soon as
he goes anywhere near a condom we have
loads of foreplay and he gets really
hard but as soon as he tries to put one
on he loses it what can we do Karen in
key thoughts now their response was have
a kiss in a comment like any 15 minutes
good luck with that she's not getting
any better looking I've gone for this as
an answer in situations such as these
it's very easy to put the onus of blame
onto the male and this can cause
enormous trauma and place unnecessary
strain on a relationship
therefore it's worth reminding you it's
often the woman's fault the penis is if
you will a barometer of sexual
attraction and if you do not meet its
high standards it's like you will go
without the sex you so cravenly demand
having said that here some tips that
might help if your boyfriend wears
glasses perhaps suggest he takes them
off for sex
simple but effective
instead of using condoms why don't you
go on the pill and have weekly AIDS
tests if you do get aids lemsip can help
or you could just walk it off the sex
ones from woman's own magazine I've been
with a lovely man for six months he's
just confessed to me that he likes to
dress up in women's clothes and I'm
horrified
I feel so let down that I don't know if
I can cope from Jackie and Dunstable
I've written back pot kettle black
Jackie do you dress as a woman don't you
fucking do you hypocrite
regards Jimmy
this one requires a little bit of
maturity from everyone my boyfriend
isn't really into having me perform oral
sex he says he's just too sensitive and
it doesn't feel as good as intercourse
I've asked my other guy friends and they
tell me it's weird because all guys like
to receive oral sex are they right
I'm starting to wonder what's going on
well I've written back if you can't suck
a cock fully I don't know how to help
you how do you try practicing nodding at
people with your mouth open
[Laughter]
PS don't neglect the balls this next one
is surprisingly succinct when you
consider the subject matter one of my
vagina lips hangs lower than the other
good surgery even the mark I've said yes
but a cheaper alternative is to live as
a spinster on that cheery note do any of
you have any problems you would like me
to help you with anything at all can be
as mundane as you like always
interesting
it hurts when you we well the good news
is you have a sexually transmitted
disease
the bad news the bad news is you've
announced that it in a crowded theatre
any other any other problem oh you've
got a problem sorry yeah since you since
you were little you've been called
ginger and ginger pubes well you aren't
ginger what do you what do you fuck you
want I can see how that's happened be a
terrible miscarriage of justice if you
had dark black hair have I got any
advice to beat the bullies find someone
weaker than you and so try and turn them
against him
[Laughter]
yeah you think I'm ginger look at this
cunt
no no I mean beating the bullies it's a
it's a tough thing I think you should
always what do they say always stand up
to bullying yeah because then then it's
funny for everyone else that's how the
expression goes did your mom tell you
that no voice she just lets them do it
wow she sounds great
[Laughter]
she's not ginger as well
[Laughter]
is your father ginger if they told you
you were adopted this is a hell of a way
to find out isn't it yeah how'd you find
out you were adopted they tell you when
you were six or seven when you process
that information Oh was it monetary cost
DVD gigs and he told me we'll give you a
few more examples have a think of some
more problems come short share it'd be
good for you all funny for me one of the
other which since splitting up with my
long-term boyfriend a year ago I've had
a string of one-night stands I always
feel cheap and used in the morning and I
swear I'll never do it again
but I can't seem to stop what I've
written back quite an unusual opening to
another give me an S give me an L give
me a you give me a tea
[Music]
you know cheerleader just go whoa
you mean asking me and alchemy you give
me a tea and he went wolf
[Laughter]
god bless ER said seriously though
thanks for your letter I understand your
problem and I empathize could you be
more specific with your contact details
this is a letter to spirit and destiny
magazine it's a magazine aimed at people
but like horoscopes but also believe in
witchcraft and ghosts and all that kind
of thing has anyone here ever seen a
ghost
yeah you've seen a ghost that's
extraordinary think is it in the
magazine there's a specialist term for
people that have seen a ghost
schizophrenic have you really seen a
ghost
and an uncle you'd rather forget
yeah that's right you saw a ghost that's
right make the bad man stop stop moving
on anyway
this magazine spurn destiny is fantastic
and it's got an agony aunt column
written by a white witch apparently
they're the best ones little bit racist
if you ask me even that's the way these
people roll the letters are fantastic I
have a chronic neck problem but several
doctors and specialists can't find any
physical cause is it possible that I
brought this painful condition forward
from a past life and how can I safely
gain access to past lives to find out
I've said yes it's highly likely you
were hanged in the fifteen hundreds of
being an idiot
[Laughter]
I've got a question for people to
believe in past lives would you like to
buy some magic beans this one was
written to sugar magazine which is a
magazine aimed at fourteen-year-old
girls I'm a girl of 14 told you and I'm
deeply in love with my cousin you have
our interest we are really close such as
having sex going out to movies et cetera
salable fucking sentence
[Laughter]
one day while having sex his sister saw
us and she is torturing us and saying
she will tell both our parents um we're
a hundred percent sure our parents will
not approve
please help I've written back I say go
for it
cousins fucking why not your freakish
offspring are the closest we'll ever get
to real superheroes think about it
people like that don't have sex one day
we may run out of channel 5
documentaries this is quite sad I was
sexually abused as a child I'm worried
that my personality in history will lead
me to abuse others have you thought
about career in the Catholic Church
any Catholics in stop touching kids I
was raised Catholic the thing that used
to annoy me about church when I was
little was over standing up and sitting
down and kneeling
I wish the priest could just pick a
position and for me
[Laughter]
any other problems who else has got a
problem they'd like to share
you can't stop wanking do you mean you
do it a lot you can't ejaculate
because that's how I know I finished
if a special white wee-wee comes out of
the ends I immediately turn off whatever
I was watching
catch a glimpse of the reflection in the
TV and think oh so you what you
masturbate a lot to you rice what how
many times a day are we talking four
times a day
have you considered just giving into it
and becoming a sex offender clearly
that's the road nature is pushing you
down you must about four times it's re
you in a relationship that is that you
girlfriend you're gay but I've always
just thought if you if you're if you're
a gay man it's it's sort of easier if
you just want sex to pick someone up
[Music]
you can't always be asked if you go on
top sometimes I think that's fine that
sound you sound particularly healthy
well done you how old do you do you mind
me asking 20 okay I know 20 is pretty
reasonable yeah I think when I was your
age I think I was I was knocking a few
out a day I think we all were so we've
got a little focus group of young men
there let's just find an average here
your young fellas in your prime Emily
are you robbing out a day
what money asking you know prepared to
say
I don't if there's any other men in
their 30s became for fuck's sake there I
am coming in a softie with a beautiful
woman
[Music]
he's watching a little bit of a little
bit of blue Peter she's alright
I'm believing there's no fucking justice
you don't know go on
why are what 17
why are Willie so ugly because you're a
lesbian
[Laughter]
[Laughter]
few more of these I have a horrid
stepbrother he shout to me in my dad all
the time and I hate it I want to run
away from home what should i do Michel
14 I said yeah I've run away from home
but bear in mind the thing about your
stepbrother is he's not gonna be quite
as annoying as a serbian pimp I have
terrible period pains every six weeks
are appalling mood swings and for the
first couple of days I can hardly move
with the pain what do you recommend they
said hot water bottle bed rest in
chocolate I've gone for the rather more
old-school have you considered building
a shed in your garden where you can hide
your shame
this is a great letter I fallen for my
lodger
we get on incredibly well and have
started sleeping together I'd like to
take the relationship to the next level
but I still need the rent
I've got as far as saying well you've
gone from boarding house to brothel
any other last problems anyone else got
anything going on you're going I can see
you and I think it may have happened I
don't think there's there's any
immediate but that's nothing to be
ashamed of is it going bald no I mean my
oldies are quite cool well you know
occasionally one of you guys gets in
what you know why men go bald it's quite
interesting I read an article in New
Scientist magazine apparently men go
bald because of too much male hormone so
my advice to you is to stop swallowing
no go on my dead mom keeps on calling
here
at least twice what she's barking up the
wrong tree with you isn't she
no you you're up for it oh that's lovely
dear not deterred by finding out she's
dead he's gone yeah
I'd say he's fine I mean I think that
would seem like a rude thing to shout
out your mom's up for it but I don't
mind at all because I was warned that he
was gonna be here this evening I knew
you were gonna be here because I was
actually warned by your mom seriously
she did she warned me she said
she said my voice gonna be he'll show
he's wrong you'll probably share
something now what it comes
at least I think she was talking to me I
wasn't the only one there
[Applause]
and she had a mouthful
go on another go I do this for Olivia I
love it
any other problems we'll find what a
final couple of these I meant a man
who's wonderful then we love each other
very much
however I recently found a nice cupboard
a homemade dildo made out of cardboard
wrapped in cellophane do you think he's
gay
I've said it looks bad but on the bright
side he's recycling last one for the
past two years I've suspected that my
dad is having an affair with the
next-door neighbor should I confront him
about it
I said no don't confront him first off
look for clues to the next-door
neighbor's kids look like you have you
been told not to factor is there a hole
in the garden fence
are you sure slugs leave a trail like
that
I saw a story in the local paper it said
an 83 year old woman was marrying an 87
year old man I thought that's not gonna
last I hate it when the news price to
trick you you know you're listening to a
song in the car it finishes the news
headlines come on it's a headline that
grabs your attention something big and
bad and important has happened you think
we'll have better turn this up and pay
attention
20 killed in suicide bomb attack in
Basra well that doesn't count first I
went to a pop quiz the other night
native Cancer Research found myself
halfway through thinking how much closer
to a cure for cancer we're getting by
doing a pop quiz and then I thought well
don't be cynical look at the
best-case-scenario wife they throwing
the question what's the cure for cancer
and someone flips it I've got a question
for you Charles cool t what do you think
good thing bad thing
it's a bad thing yeah well done sir I
think it's universally acknowledged that
child cruelty is a very bad thing and
yet there are adverts on our TVs every
day saying don't smoke children never an
excuse to smack a child that's just
telling us the blatantly obvious isn't
it I think they should have to take a
little bit of the money they spend on
those adverts telling us not to smack
our children and spend a bit on advert
I'm specifically a children simply
saying behave let's face it there's no
smoke without fire
no one's throwing out cigarettes on
children that are just quietly coloring
in in the corner are though
those drink-driving adds a horrific army
a like 30-second horror films my
favorite two or three years ago and it
was it panned down a hospital corridor
to find this man sitting in a hospital
bed being fed mushy food by a nurse and
the voice-over simply said this is a
drunk driver and you find yourself
thinking will it be something of a
liability behind the wheel sober
has anyone here ever driven groans
anyone by show hands anyone you you know
well I admire your honesty you know I
hope nothing bad happened when you did
that and let's face it there were
mitigating circumstances when you drove
drunk you were pissed we've all done
things we regret we're pissed some of
you may be with one of them this evening
I hope nothing bad happened when you
drove drunk you know I think if they
made and I've about the normal
experience it would just be a bloke
waking up the next day with an extra 20
quid nice Molly because you didn't have
to pay for a cab
it would be shocking but in it it from
mine I think the people that make the
drunk driving ad should be forced to
make an advert specifically at
pedestrians simply saying pedestrians
watch where you go in some of us about a
drink
it costs 165 thousand pounds to raise a
child's at the age of 18 in the UK
that's why I've sponsor one in Africa
it's a pound a week
one in four African children has a gun
think about that the other three are
fucked I'll tell you what they need in
sub-saharan Africa a little slightly
cheaper we can't afford that
she the most callous thing I heard about
famine in Africa was not from another
comedian you know trying to make light
of it but it was from two ladies in
their 50s in a doctor surgery in North
London and one of them was looking at
the headlines in the paper and it was
all about the famine and she just put
down the paper and said rhetorically
this famine is terrible isn't it and I
found without skipping a beat when yeah
but they don't get our winters you know
why he's hot
and I'm ashamed to say a small part of
me when it does always no nice course
the big campaign the last couple of
years will stop third-world debt what I
can't understand is how they're getting
into debt in the first place
there's no fucking chance what idiots a
day boys given a Kalahari Bushmen
interest-free credit on a stereo
I still can't understand how the third
world hasn't consolidated their debts
into one easy monthly payment
surely that's the way forwards they
should get in touch with the good people
of ocean finance have you seen those
commercials they're incredible they take
15 of the ugliest people you've ever
seen and they all say exactly the same
thing down the lens as if it's taking
every ounce of their wit to get this
simple sentence out they all say they
made it so easy they made it so easy and
you're looking at it thinking well
they're kinda fuckin hurt
if they'd made it complicated you
wouldn't have understood and if they're
being difficult it would have been a bit
like work and you don't like that nyan
are you going to this mess
my favorite thing about natural
disasters and I know it's wrong to have
a list
certainly getting it laminated was a
mistake but Mike my favorite thing about
natural disasters is the fact they call
them acts of God and then two days later
they have a day of prayer so the day of
prayer for an act of God what I want to
know is how does that prayer go dear
Lord
what the fuck you know was all about
half the people that have ever smoked
have now stopped which sounds good but
when I say stop a lot of them
I just think there's nicer ways of
saying things I'm not saying I've got a
lot of nieces and nephews is a nice way
to say my sister is a slut she favors
the flattered Xu is a nice way to say
lesbian surprise sex is a lovely term
for rape scared of the dark is a nice
way to say horrible racist I'm thinking
of launching a fragrance is a nice way
to say my finger
when I was at school a girl called Alice
whacked off a dog for three cigarettes I
know what you're thinking the dog gets
cigarettes
I think British men have got a fairly
terrible reputation in the bedroom we're
always saying the wrong thing I remember
once having a one-night stand with a
girl and after the sex she turned to me
and jokingly said who's gonna sleep in
the wet patch I said you're optimistic
I'm not staying
this is a good story about how bad
British men are in the sack I've got a
friend he went on holiday to IB hoobs
about 25 at the time and he picked up a
girl got her back to the villa they made
love underneath the moonlight on the
verandah sounds fairly romantic I think
as a setting but he managed to fuck it
up don't worry about that
she turned to him she said talk dirty to
me
no more accurately talk dirty a couple
of seconds to think okay gentlemen
you've all got a couple of seconds just
go to the place in your head a little
rolodex of dirt next to the wank Bank
generally you you know you've got
something smarter you could get out
pretty quickly
you've all got something right he had a
few seconds to think he came up with a
following
have some of that new fat slang
you first
fucking pretty quickly followed by why
are you crying in terms of romance is
right up there with Willie won't suck
itself
I'm not saying that women aren't as bad
women can be is bad I once I'm on side
text with an Australian girl she said
mid-coitus whilst working she said have
you slimed yet he slimed yet
he ghostbusters
I fantasize about having sex with the
gymnasts not just because they're really
bendy and flexible and you could do
loads of extrordinary positions but also
because I imagine they do a brilliant
dismount they end up by the side of the
bed like that
and if they bend their knees even just a
little bit you couldn't make them do it
again
[Music]
80% of person Alliance say good sense of
humor required and the reason 80% of
person allowed to say good sense of
humor required is because everything
else in the personal ad is a lie you
turn up on the blind date she says I
know I said it was petite and pretty
[Laughter]
you think yeah I notice it also says you
enjoy long walks which is handy because
you can fuck right off
[Laughter]
there's quite a lot of couples in I can
see lots of couples around the place if
you all had the sexual history
conversation not all of you clearly the
sexual history conversation happens
about three four five months into a
relationship and the woman says to the
man I'd like to know about your sexual
history and the man thinks I know you've
hooked him wouldn't but the woman
doesn't just ask once she keeps on
asking until she gets a result yeah I
had this recently I was cornered had to
have the sexual history conversation I
had to list every woman I've ever been
with from the girl I lost my virginity
to right the way up to her and that is
where I should have stopped
[Laughter]
are you all familiar with the spider-man
yes the sexual practice don't panic I'll
explain the spider-man is a sexual
practice whereby you making love to a
woman from behind that's key to this
operation you're just about to arrive
and you've got your happy face on you
look like a turtle shitting you pull out
to catch spider-man
I realize many of you are looking at me
thinking well why did he tell us that
that sounds horrible it sounds very
aggressive not very romantic and loving
but the reason I'm telling you is
because men are such bad communicators
especially at times of high emotion like
a breakup so gentlemen I don't think you
ever need to have that awkward it's not
me it's you conversation again I think
next time when you think the
relationship has run its course simply
spider-man she will either think that
was brilliant
in which case she's a keeper
this is a very sweet
Babita me cough thank you very much
indeed
[Applause]
[Applause]
[Music]
what phone call
what jokes do you want to hear again
I'll tell you what you can do if you've
been in a relationship a couple of years
and the sex is still fantastic but it's
got a bit routine you know you do the
same things in the same order on the
same night of the week or whatever it's
got a bit kind of predictable your sex
life what you can do is the next time
you're getting sucked off pull out come
and Ryan then kick you in the shin
it's clearly pirates
[Laughter]
I saw a homeless guy getting off the bus
how does he know is he stop
there's a guy near me sells the big
issue is goes it's my last one come on
if you buy this I'm going you've got the
point that this at all I'm not in favor
of ID cards but the very simple reason I
don't know how we're going to pick them
up at the post office
I love come for my ID card have you got
any ID I was in the airport those
treadmills they've got shoes
[Laughter]
they're much better than the ones in the
supermarket I get very self-conscious
I got talking the other day about
professional wrestling and we were
talking about the item of clothing they
wear in professional wrestling which is
an all-in-one leotard called a unitard
I thought unitard that sounds like a
special-needs kid with a hole
unitards
[Laughter]
potentially very dangerous because
they're always trying to come in for our
hog game I take your eye out well that's
almost the end of the show I had a girl
come up to me after a show a couple of
weeks ago at the stage door she waited
for me she looked me boldly in the eyes
and said I'm not wearing any panties I
thought forgetful I've watched peacock
what a pair I was walking between the
sage store and the car this about six
months ago and there was a girl as I was
walking I saw her between two cars
hissing I double took on the second take
I made eye contact which is all and she
said mid-flow
I thought if you've got any paper you
need it and then you know what I did I
waited
enjoy the show yeah River shake it's not
the worst thing that's happened after a
gig I had a guy come up to me this was
in Edinburgh and he was he was miles
away was about like 100 meters away and
I just heard this voice thick Scottish
accent saying say my penis and I thought
that's weird it sounds like that bloke
said sign my penis freaky and then as he
got closer transpired that not only was
he saying say my penis what are you
saying I said I could initial it for it
one of my favorite things to do on a
busy Saturday afternoon yeah is you know
the animal rights people you get in the
middle of town they've got a trestle
table out just saw outside the shops and
they've got quite grisly posters up of
animals in distress if you're an animal
lover it is heartbreaking to see and
they've got the leaflets and the
petitions that you can sign and they've
got four main posters wherever you go in
the country there's there's an emaciated
dog in a tiny cage a cat that's been
shaved with wires coming out of it a
monkey missing the top of its head and
you can tell it's still alive from its
eyes but obviously in horrible pain and
a rabbit with stuff being poured in its
eyes to test whether it's safe for us
I'm guessing what I like to do if I'm
bored on a Saturday afternoon I look up
to that table and go
[Laughter]
Master surely the best thing about
getting a face transplant good setup
isn't it
it's exciting what comes next
surely the best thing about getting a
face
