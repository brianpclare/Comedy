segues are weird um I had a uh I had a
hot dog for breakfast today and
afterwards I felt like this because I
couldn't control my stools all right
Jesus pledged like poop based puns

little lesson for comedians um this
first song is called a world on fire
it's next song a little bit a little bit
longer than that one and thank the host
that I am I'm really sad that's called
sad
[Music]
it's about all the sad stuff just
picture depressed onion cutting itself
[Music]
I met a homeless man named rich
isn't that terrible I sort of flyer for
a lost dog and the dog didn't have any
legs it's not a diabetic kid
[Music]
trick-or-treating
I saw rich Arab who had a short neck
that was sad for a deer I saw an old man
get hit by a train he didn't see it in
the pouring rain
eat it and hear me shout look out for
the Train
cuz I didn't say anything
I just thought to myself whoo this is
gonna be sad and it was I'm a genius
I saw a man with only one eye
in a 3d movie I saw a little boy dropped
his ice cream cone directly on his
mother's corpse I saw a kid stuck in a
tree then the King jumped off and he
hung itself I saw a boy who had red hair
I went to a store looking for something
to buy but they only sold paintings of
the same sad guy no way the store sells
mirrors see what I did there let's rock
roll so sad bros
Payne genocide for sexism racism but
kind of remember there's good things
about it too like the fact that none of
that's happening to me
score
[Music]
still though it's hard not to be sad
about it how do you all do it I've been
telling you guys terribly sad things
this whole song you've been sad at all
you've been you've been happy no you've
been laughing that's it laughter it's
the key to everything it's the way to
solve all the sadness in the world I
mean not for the people that are
actually sad but the people I gots
they're gonna fucking deal with them all
the time
being a comedian isn't being an
insensitive prick capitalizing in the
most animalistic impulses of the public
it's being a hero
the world isn't sad the world's funny
I'm a sociopath I saw an old man slip
and fall what a fucking idiot I saw a
woman at her daughter's funeral ha ha ha
classic comedy everything that once was
sad is somehow funny now the Holocaust
in 9/11
that shit's funny 24/7 good tragedy will
be exclusively chose about
because my empathy is bomb and me
[Music]
goodbye sadness hello jokes
[Music]
I got a really good joke about video
editors video editors are so fucking I
think we should do a poem right now if

sappy a little bit romantic so we'll get
it out of the way now and we will go

pull you apart but don't trust these

language because he had his heart broken

Bluebird drop from a tree and take to
the air me neither

the rhyme but the right words just
weren't there meat cleaver
the people in my life for like grains of
sand cuz they stick together often near
my butthole if life is an ocean I am a
deep and handsome fish a fish that's
drowning
if the artistic process is the birth
canal then I am a freshly jellied kid
it come witness my crime
[Music]
these thoughts of mine
and must be a sign that I
[Music]
Jesus can walk on water can he swim on
land
have you ever accidentally peed on the
toilet seat instead of on your
girlfriend's face meaning me neither

[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
don't you hate it when that happens
yeah thank you that's called beating off
an a-minor yes yes a minor the key not
the felony um so I believe I believe
there's nothing more manly one can do
then take a shower to five other guys
it's true it's early caveman cro-magnon
wandering through the fog
you know scrubbing five other sapiens no
homo um wish I'd like to do a little uh
do some poems right now if that's okay
just we're on the point of the show
these poems are actually from I'm
releasing this special for free so I'm
going to plug my poetry book that these
are my new poems for my poetry book
called egghead that will be out by the
time is airing but not by the time you
guys are seated here right now so uh
it's good they're pretty serious and
it's all just sort of a tit this is sort
of the lull of the show usually smelling
tea at this point sort of take the
pressure off the audience and just read
some poems and then we'll go back to the
giggles so this is a poem by a dog roses
are grey violets are a different shade
of grey let's go chase cars
[Applause]
me with my strange choice of adjectives
you with your muscular teeth and
clockwise vagina I put a chameleon on a
red dildo oh he blushed there we go this
is the poem about beauty about
self-image and about the ability to
transform Martha was ugly like a shaven
baboon
so she wrapped herself up in a curtain
cocoon and after a week she finally
emerged she smelled like shit what a
psycho your incomparable like a
I want to beat you to death with a blunt
object I want to grab one of those
high-end fashion mannequins by the
ankles and bastard rib cage in I'm gonna
sharpen 50 pencils bind them of the
rubber bands
take the Len in your mouth and punch the
erasers or to strap you to a bed of
nails then strut that bit of nails to
the hood of my car so I can watch you
suffer as we drive over speed bumps the
mall parking lot during an earthquake I
want you to somehow survive a terrible
car crashed and somehow not survive a
small fender bender on the way back in
the hospital
thank you that's called dad this is the
poem it's really a story that's meant
primarily for children but I think it's
got a lesson we could all learn the
squares lived happily in their Square
houses in their square yard in their
square town but then one day a family of
circles moved in from the West
get out of here round these shouted one
of the squares why said one of the
circles cuz this the metaphor for racism
um
[Applause]
when I walk into a party you'd think I
was one of those long straight Tetris
pieces because everyone's just like oh
yeah this guy's here finally we've been
waiting for him to show up like you wait
in the game forget it
I mean no you had your chance right if I
a million dollars I'd pay your mother to
have sex with me afterwards I'd probably
invest the remaining nine hundred ninety
nine thousand nine hundred ninety
dollars ten dollars for sex with your
mother comedy is I smell comedy well he
was comedy giving off that scent
and finally mid-october with leaves
spilled like colored pencil shavings the
streets dicing our town into neat unfair
portions and me eating that pussy baby
thank you so much
um there's things that I don't want to
come across in my show that I worried
off and come across about me because
people realize but it's an act up here I
don't want you to ever think that I
think I'm better than people or that I
think I know better than people anyway
okay
this is a song from the perspective of
God
you
you
oops you think I wrote her way too thick
who needs a thousand metaphors to figure
out you shouldn't be a dick and I don't
watch you when you sleep
surprisingly I don't use my omnipotence
to be a fucking creep
you're not going to heaven why the fuck
would you think I'd ever kick it with
you
none of you are going to
there's a trillion aliens cooler than
you
you shouldn't abstain from rape just cuz
you think that I want you to you should
and rape cos rape is a fucked up thing
to do
pretty obvious just done fucking rape
people do nothing man shall write that
one down for you
I don't think masturbation is obscene
it's absolutely natural and the weirdest
fucking thing I've ever seen can make my
job a living hell
I send gays to fix overpopulation
pointed patka well you're not
wing to heaven eat a thousand crackers
sing a million hymns
none of you are going to heaven
you're not my children you're a bad game
of sim you shouldn't abstain from pork
just cuz you think that I want you to
you can eat pork because why the fuck
would I give a shit
it created the universe thing I'm
drawing the line the fucking deli aisle
[Music]
you argue and you bicker and you fight
atheists and Catholics Jews and Hindus
argued day and night over what they
think is true but no one entertains the
thought that maybe God does not believe
in here you pray so badly for
knowing any day might be the day that
you die but maybe life on earth could be
heaven doesn't just the thought of it
make it worth a try
my love the type of thing that you have
to earn and when you were
you won't need it huh my love's the type
of thing that you have to earn it when
you were
you won't meet and not gonna give you
love just cuz I know that you want me to
if you want love and the lovers gotta
come from you
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
between the my
tell me about it women are stupid yeah I
fucking said it the weaker Dumber sex I
can prove it to you I'd like to practice
safe sex why cuz I'm a guy and I'm
smarter
what do women say every time every time
I put on a condom what do they say why
are you wearing a condom if I'm fucking
you with a strap-on to be safe bitch
women right there the dumb one it's time
for a story let's do a story it's time
for a story it's time for a story a very
special story especially for you it's
time for a story it's time for a story
sit down and listen now don't be a Jew
the story is called Andy that's a glitch
you can be Jewish this story this story
is called Andy the Frog featuring long
and convoluted similes now warn you when
one of those long convoluted similes
rears its old head so here we go once
upon a time there was a frog named Andy
whoo Andy lived at the Patton Park pond
had never hopped anywhere else in his
entire frog life he had three best
friends Millie who never left her lily
pad Billy who was always hopping mad and
Roger who was arrested for possession of
tadpole porn so one day one day annie
saw something hop across the grass on
the other side of the pond Millie Billy
Roger looks at Andy across the pond
stood the most beautiful frog and he'd
ever seen she's gorgeous said Millie
she's beautiful said Billy bit old for
my taste at Roger classic Roger
and then she was gone I need to go find
her sedan D I need to follow my little
frog hard so and II followed the
beautiful frogs footsteps into the
forest he then came across a turtle you
can't pass said the turtle please said
Andy no said the turtle and now this is
the first long convoluted simile then
there was a rustling in the bushes and
like a man who had been shot in the
chest with a rifle the turtle was shot
in the chest with a rifle and he kept
moving but at this point like the doctor
of the canyon track team his patience
ran thin and he kept moving he then came
across a giant crocodile in the
crocodile began to chant I woke up this
morning and I sat on a log I opened up
the menu the menu said frog and he said
no no please they caught me I can feel
myself dying you're ripping out my
insides I'm never gonna find your mi
there's no God is there fuck fuck
the end the end so the end of that story
[Music]
yeah if you're curious the moral of that
story it's irrelevant because we're
humans why would it apply to us um you
know my father is so hard to get along
with because he's such a man's man you
know he believes like for example you
should always fight fire with fire
which is a horrible way to live your
life especially for him because he's a
firefighter so he was fired
that was as stupid as we get but let's
get a little stupider huh
there's a creepy old man fishing in the
park and the only problem is he tied
again he barred in the end of his line
he's trying to catch a kid you know that
stuff trying to get a little more
mainstream um people complain about the
way I act on stage very often you know
they say like I repeat jokes or they
also say that they say they don't get
again that this is an act on stage they
think on stage I act - arrogant -
self-obsessed solipsistic self-contained
synonyms and they want me to be they
want me to be a comic of the people you
know relate to the people with the
overarching glue of comedy so I went to
a little bit of a relatable comedy for
you guys I'm like you guys you know once
a week like to slip into a deep
existential depression or I lose all my
sense of oneness and self-worth haha and
what I like to do in order to assure
myself that I am unique I'm not just one
of many small white indistinguishable
perfectly cylindrical pieces and Jesus
and Satan's backgammon game is I will
I'll say a group of words that I think
no one has ever said in that order so
that when I say it I feel like look at
me participating in this new moment that
no one's ever been a part of so I'll say
something random like like peanut butter
tribalism or I'm your father and I loved
your comedy show
or at first I wasn't comfortable leaving
him alone with my children but then I
saw his mustache phew
or uh or go check out this Amish website
or or I work at a tollbooth and I don't
want to kill myself or that's too too
real
oh yo man my life's about three things
man three things getting money getting
pussy and the Dewey Decimal System or uh
[Applause]
or hey can you hold my fanny pack
I'm gonna go fuck a woman um if I could
break I want to thank you all for being
here because uh I mean it I'm so
grateful that you'd all come here and
spend an hour of your time with me and
if you're watching it home or whatever
on a computer or something uh if you've
made it this far thank you very much for
watching genuinely I there's my favorite
thing to do and I'm so grateful for
people watching it and enjoying it um
okay I will now receive back into my
stage persona I just blacked out for 20
seconds
thank you for coming
love songs used to be so beautiful you
know let us go then you and I when the
evening is spread out against the sky
like a patient etherized upon a table TS
Eliot beautiful love songs nowadays just
as beautiful guys
uh sure Justin Bieber 1d you know them
but these new artists they've done
something very strange to the format of
the love song they've changed it a bit
I tried to capture how they've changed
the format of the love song with this
love song I hope you enjoy it and Mark
the differences
[Music]
Jason Derulo

love your sister I love your dad I love
your mum but more than all of that I
love the fact that you are dumb enough
to not realize everything I've said has
been said before in a thousand waves and
a thousand songs some with the same four
chords but you'll still love it and let
me finger you
yeah I'm finger yelping are you oh girl
I hope you don't think that I'm rude
when I tell you that I love you boo I
also hope that you don't see through
this cleverly constructed ruse designed
by a marketing team cashing in on
puberty and low self-esteem and girls
desperate need to feel loved in America
says we love a chorus but don't get
complicated for us though meaning might
be missing we need to know the words
after just one listen so repeat stuff
you repeat that repeat that repeat that
repeat that repeat that repeat that
repeat that
repeat that yeah oh you know it
[Music]
I love my baby and you know I couldn't
live without her but now I need to make
every girl think the songs about her
just to make sure that they spread it
like the plague so I described my dream
girl is really really vague like I love
your hands because your fingerprints are
like no other I love your eyes and their
bluish brownish greenish color I love it
when you smile that you style wide and I
love how your torso as an arm on either
side now if you're my agent you might be
thinking oh no sound the alarms you're
not appealing to little girls who don't
have arms but they can use iTunes so

respond to this you know introspective
material or these challenges to the form

can relate to okay so write a write a
silly song about Facebook you know write
some write some jokes about our Twitter
er or sugary cereals or razor scooters
relate to them you know also you got to
