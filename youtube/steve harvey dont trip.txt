this is more of an evolution for me I've
involved into this person that I am at
manifest it's been a long journey
professionally for me it's been over 20
years to get to this night I've been
standing on that stage flat-footed with
a mic and I've been cussing man and you
know you get concerned when you get
around Church people are they gonna be
judgmental cuz that's what kind of hurts
you a lot of time so many people in the
church they judge you based on something
they hear you say in an act like they
never saying I'm not aligned or they
only do nothing crazy when they at home
or they see and free and that bugs you
man I've been singing in choirs all my
life going to church man so you know
it's nothing that that I don't know
about you know I know about church
that's why when I write jokes about the
church I know what I'm telling us coming
from a place in me I'm cool I know how
to write to joke what to say bottle I
know how to bounce
oh man I'm set to a whole lot of time
you know and you close the advice will
you close your show you would say if you
ain't got God you ain't got none you can
believe and take that to the bank
man cause without God you in the
straight struggle I'm just glad I'm
going I'm glad you got me to this point
where I can even face a crowd like it
megafest and really if you judge me then
go ahead but my mama say is something
that I often times your number one a
minute spots like this - they hung Jesus
on the cross and he and do nothing to
nobody
so how you figure you gonna get through
this thing's got free and you you been
cussing talking about people cracking on
people's half shoes talking about they
clothes and you think you're gonna walk
through this land and they ain't nobody
gonna try to do you I don't think so no
that's real that's right ladies and
gentlemen please fuck up to the stage
yes
y'all do better now I said Meg offense
before I get started always thought by
saying God is everything but if it
hadn't been for God I never ever would
have been nothing well
I'm back
let's just get this out the way right
now by your heads
gracious God our Father please don't let
Steve cuss
while he open here this evening in Jesus
name Amen
I want to thank y'all
I want to thank you all for having me
back I appreciate it
for y'all letting me come here to do my
thing in front of y'all again
I love Bishop Jake's for giving me this
chance a year ago I came out I did 20
minutes and I called him up I said I
loved it so much I say I think I want to
change man he said why don't you come
back do the whole show I don't know how
I've been standing on stage I've been
standing on stage for 20 years cussing I
never came onstage in 20 years and ain't
cussed I'm gonna do over our tonight

mistake I have already given this DVD a
title that covers me is kind of like a
loophole a song the name of this DVD

his hair condition of it
I can't even finish that joke that's
funny to me how long oh I'm gonna get
y'all money worth tonight I ain't lyin
to you why
seeing our kids our kids are different
to us because everybody love a kid and
you should everybody encourage their
kids and you're supposed to you're
supposed to tell your child that they
are the most brilliant things walking
you're supposed to tell your children
yes you can
you're supposed to tell your children
you'll be anything you want to be you're
posed to tell your children that the
world is theirs if they want it if they
hold on and keep your faith you Botha
tell that to your kids someone's just
raising our kids with fear yang ah no
don't be talking about all that shut up
with your Ignace self and let your child
talk about whatever he want to talk
about long as any time i doing nothing
wrong if he think he want to be a doctor
and your stupid behind can't see nobody
in your Ignace family being a doctor so
what maybe the baby got a chance if you
don't kill it in
pants ought to be encouraging to the kid
now some of y'all takes it a little bit
too far
telling everybody about your baby like
you don't want got a smart baby even the
parents aren't really careful always
bragging on a baby like your baby just
over there you just be bragging on the
man oh my baby
well my baby just brilliant he's so
small
yeah he might be but what you need to do
is put your little fo year ole around
some other Folio you might find out that
your little boy is retarded
stop comparing your baby to you when you
was full cuz it don't match I had a lady
come to me the other day to see Steve
you so wrong about that my baby is so
smart do you know that my baby is three
years old you know my baby can work a
remote do you know when I was three
years old I couldn't work a remote hello
you didn't have a remote you know how
you used to change your channel you got
up you walked over to that big TV that
no longer had a knob on it you grab them
pliers on top of the TV and you stop and
you had to be careful with their blows
cuz you can't go past the station cuz
you came back it
you'd be done then you'll be bragging on
your baby - you'll be just talking about
you like your child is just a genius but
see that I said something about your
child your child is educated with the
help of TV TV on 24/7
you ain't even got to teach your
children some things that TV is on now
it may be learning something wrong but
they learn it son they got Nickelodeon
Sesame Street the Discovery Channel
Cartoon Network of B et MTV kids and
they're learning all types of crap you
ain't had it when you was growing up cuz
how many of y'all remember when tv went
off when TV yes went smooth oh oh
by the dawn's early light what so
proudly we just waving you try to turn
your chatter hope somebody feel
see indeed when you're on stage and
you're telling the truth about stuff
people get touchy see people don't like
racial humor I use it all the time I've
been black forty eight years you ain't
fitting the fool me that it ain't here
no mo
you could quit talking to me about it I
don't care if I'm at the church or
whatever I see it all the time and I
thank God that y'all got enough sense to
come together with it and don't matter
but megafest ain't anywhere
sometime it do matter and I'm on point
with it see I look for it it ain't that
I got a chip on my shoulder but you
can't come to me with it
cuz I just ain't that good at Christian
yet I've been working on them
Commandments but I it's - nope nope
I'm good for about you know six seven of
them but to mother3 I'd be struggling
with a lot over you know y'all yeah I
got the laugh I don't care that's just a
fact
you know everybody drop them we're off
every nineteen I'm just real Lisa it you
know some of y'all ain't gonna make it
in cuz you lying to yourself but that's
cool I see it in your face that's cool
that's cool
it's alright but I do it see why people
down south they a lot like black people
southern whites and blacks is pretty
much the same get up north white folks
is different
made a lot of men here that tell you
something right there they're just
different you might disagree but it
ain't show show I think black people and
white people sometimes discipline their
kids different lot of y'all agree with
me but sitting next to him and you don't
wanna say nothing so I'm cool with that
part too
I just think it's a difference sometime
I was in the mall one day and this white
lady stopped me I was in a department
stole my wife had sent me an edited by
something and I was in the department
store and a white lady camera took real
nice lady she said oh goodness it is you

how to spell it I didn't go lie to you I
don't know where the end go to posture
fit none of that I just ain't never to
spell isn't what fall sick it's you
isn't it and so I just said yeah I guess
guess it is Dana

to see you oh he was just to die for
that's another phrase they use that
throws me what you mean to die for well
why you gonna bring him out of here
leave that boy where she said would you
mind signing an autograph for my son
that's one thing I never do I never
turned down children for pictures and
autographs and I never turned down the
elderly because I just think old people
made the way possible for me and kids

about you so I do that every time
whether I want to or not now y'all in
the middle pain whatever you know get
past it Steve tripping whatever so I

hello since somebody over there do
something to you I just just saw about
that probably shouldn't say it that US I
was going real good a minute ago would
that's just the truth my own you know I
don't like fighting and nothing like
that but hey you know you can't be
pushing on me either though that I ain't
that good a Christian I got a next-door
neighbor I ain't sayin nothin him in six
years and that's going on with who
nothin you know he don't speak to me
what I'm over their fault I don't care
if you don't speak to me ain't that good
a Christian you all speak to me I ain't
speaking to you you don't love me I
don't love you here
I ain't loving my enemy I ain't there
yet I'm trying to get there
but I ain't dead yet you stay over there
still hit I why we got the wall look
that's what the wall is full he says
something crazy to my son one day I went
over there I tried to think of something
spiritual on my way but you know I tried
to throw a Bible verse in there but I
rang the doorbell he said what's going
on
I'll tell you what next time say
something crazy to my son I come over
here imma kill you
Jesus well
that's all I had for it's uh
I just tried to close it with a Bible
verse but it yes
see it's amazing you move out in these
neighborhoods when you get blessed and
you run into some old problems but see
let me tell you something don't be
afraid to move move anyhow because
that's why you got to bless it so you
could go out there and be around nice
houses and stuff ain't nothing wrong
when you move my friends dog me out when
I got money and move oh you just gonna
move out the hood your dog going right
up by you don't go right I'm going I
wish I would stay here you know y'all
still I told them you know good where
y'all stole I used to steal with you I
go on a trip on weekend y'all back in
the truck up taking all myself I'm going
you just got the moves some time and you
ain't got to feel bad about it
cuz you've been blessing you got the
money to go that's what your posters do
you both look like God done something
for you ain't that the truth
I was at a gospel celebration one time
lady look at me and said you need Jesus
you need to know Jesus well I might not
know him like you think I know him
but I bet I look like I know him though
I got it from somewhere
you do the math on that so I'm let go by
you to let people check you all you want
to I ain't for that I'm Angie you say
something L say something right back to
you that's why I ain't got no ulcers and
no stress fractures and an upset stomach
and indigestion cuz you say something
crazy to me i crush y'all i yep well
yeah that's what I do I ain't got to fix
that that's hot that's hot stay
stress-free I lets it go you say
something crazy to me watch out I'm
trying to get better find another way
but you know people do so I hear y'all
all the time people do something y'all
say I'm pray for you that's good that's
good I tried that they really do what I
wanted it to do I want a shocked look on
your face when I say something back say
some crazy to me and I look crazy when I
come back I want you to look crazy to
you know I kill you I'm a pray for you
mmm-hmm i'ma kill you I kill everybody
in your whole family
and just feel better to me I'm sorry
it's been working for me trying to come
up with something else but that show
felt good it don't kill everybody in
your whole family and then you got to be
conscious cuz see when God bless you
remember this don't let your friends
make you think you got to take them with
you that's the dangerous track see if
God had wanted them to had a blessing
data worked hard kept the faith and they
the got a blessing but they worked hard
like you they kept the faith not ain't
got no blessing now they want you to
drag them with you uh-uh that they had
work I'm telling you but you got to cut
some of your friends loose when you
start doing better you can cut them
loose or their drag you down I'm telling
you this is real talk now ain't no joke
in there that's real talk go listen to
me you can take them to the company
picnic with you if you want to you gonna
mess around and won't have no job no
Lord you over there playing volleyball
over here over here you you just having
fun at the picnic all of a sudden you
hear
you look over their feet and busted your
boss in the head with a baseball bat
say man what'd you do that for
cuz he was looking at me
took his ignant behind to the company
picnic now you ain't got no job no money
you know when you when you do comedy you
have an imagination that's incredible
man see God has given me three eyes he's
giving me the two like y'all got and
this third eye sits up here and I see
everything and the comedy in it and the
underlying current in it that's an
amazing thing to have another eye it
gives you some great days because you
can laugh at a lot of stuff and bring
you a lot of pain too because you see
stuff that a lot of people don't see
comedians is in a lot of pain manners
and Katz's out there struggling with
their lives because they cease this real
now I'm just telling you the truth
that's what the gift of comedy is is
another eye to see things another way
and sometimes your imagination it makes
you wonder about stuff you know like I
just wonder sometime if all I went to
church and a pastor would just go off
some of y'all probably already seen it
but I'm talking about just go off and
just start telling you know the truth
really really just a truth maybe just
tell somebody a self just to make you
feel a little more comfortable like
maybe you can make it to if you knew
your path to have some problems in
troubles maybe you think you can get
through to that's something I just want
to hear somebody just go off so right
now I'm gonna let you in on something
that I have always wanted to do and I'm
gonna ask our sister Bernice Jenkins
if she will come on up
crazy

biggest names in the world from secular

Year I've hosted two BT Awards me and
say it started that I've hosted the
essence awards I've hosted B et Comedy
Awards I've hosted every celebration of
gospel that they've ever had I was
sitting up thinking to myself and just
go with me on this it's just me again
with that third I just wondering what
someone would be like I was wondering
just in my imagination of the ultimate
introduction that if I had the chance to
bring out Jesus
I was thinking for what I say with this
third eye with my ability as a comedian
what would I say if somebody let me
introduce him cuz he gonna get
introduced one day it's what my mama has
always my mother taught me as 36 years
of a Sunday school teacher that Jesus
were gonna come back one day I believe
that through every piece of hard time
out of hand and y'all see me on tape and
it don't look like I know him trust me I
know him every day there's no way I
could have got here without it
what I believe has gotten me here this
is real talk so if you will just imagine
with me if I had the pleasure of
bringing out Christ this is just how I
would do it it ain't got to be the way
you do it you might not think it's just
right but this is how I would do
ladies and gentlemen it is my honor to
introduce a man who needs no
introduction his credits are too long to
