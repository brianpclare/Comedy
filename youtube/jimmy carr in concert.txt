working a child's bed is amorphous it's
almost impossible to explain their shoot
away
well it's certainly only an even let's
try some easy jokes to start with shall
we
good luck I was in the South of France I
saw a brownie on a school trip she was
holding up a book it said on the front
rough guide I thought yeah she's no look
three percent of Britons never leave a
tip and they're known as the weirdos
that live
I saw a headline it said Britain faces
crisis what we're running out of faces
when someone recommends a book to me and
they say it's a page-turner I would
think yeah when our books work I bought
a home pregnancy kit turns out my house
is pregnant
we're thrilled we're having a shit I got
interviewed last week by a very nice
young lady she said what's your house
like I said I've got a semi which would
have been fine but then I showed it and
of course by then it wasn't me if you
ask ten randomly chosen women how often
they wash their knickers a surprising
number answer how did you get in here
freedom mean keep them keen that's what
they say isn't it treat them in keeping
what I think you've gone too far if
using a Stanley knife course a lot of
women stay with them and even if their
men hid them a lot of women will stay
with their husbands even if their
husbands beat them
I study what they need
she was tiny
of course the thing people never say
about domestic violence and it strikes
me as being just a very obvious but
people never say this about domestic
violence
it's just how fucking stupid it is I
mean you're hitting your wife it's your
wife might as well kill your own fucking
car think about it you don't like her
now you're not gonna like her anymore
with two black eyes and a bit of a face
on oh yeah there are places in the
country where that's just a joke I did
that joke in Preston it was like
marriage guidance
it got around a little Klaus but I
thought was around applause it was
actually people he's seen their wives
when I was a kid I was scared of the
dentist
I suppose that begs the question how
many fillings did he give me
I believe each and every child should be
given a chance and that's why if they
can guess the number I'm thinking of
is anyone in from around the country
you're from London where you from
you're from Doncaster and you're down
here just for the lights you'll be back
in telling people or I was inside it was
like a cave but it was like daytime at
night
well done you
it's lovely to have you New Zealand
how's he going over there alright you
still having that problem with Saruman
and he's all Carmy
Hori for madam ja food
you saw what command worry from madam
a horrible break sister from the
seventies
[Music]
I will see you what story you're from
Sevenoaks but you said hello but wasn't
you why are you talking he said that not
me
I'm from Seven Oaks
what do you do madam you were soon on
what are you studying drama really you
know I always say the same thing
whenever I meet a drama student an
aspiring actress or actor I always say
the same thing to any aspiring actor or
actress I meet
I was in Newcastle recently I was in the
back of a cab in Newcastle and the cab
driver said to me there's no red light
district in Newcastle because that's how
they talk if you're a Newcastle for the
weekend its most disconcerting because
you find yourself thinking who is
everyone trying to start a sing song and
I just don't know the words there's no
red light district in Newcastle
incidentally I hadn't got on the back of
a cab in Newcastle and said take me to
the prostitutes my good man no just
soundproof I have nothing this bloke
went to me
there's no red latest week in Newcastle
now I didn't say anything this was quite
a big tough purely bloke but I did think
to myself a tell you why no need
have you been to Newcastle to Bacardi
breezers and the deal is done
it's the kind of town where if you've
got money enough for chips guess what
great news you're not going home in your
own
it was a nice little smile there this is
if to say I tell you why I like chips
and cock
you don't yeah you know in big brother
when they swear they play in that
birdsong I've got so used to that and
now in spring watches on I think the
Badgers are calling Bill Oddie account
a friend come around to my house the
other day distressed and destroyed was
nearly in tears a grown man
he said have got a lump on my testicle I
said that be your other test
Michael stop tell you about one of those
charity muggers
you know the ones in the high street
with a clipboard and the optimism you
stopped me and said if you give five
pounds a month no children will get hurt
like a fucking protection racket
speaking of charity though the largest
charitable contribution in human history
was made last year an American man gave
away 32 billion dollars he was some kind
of Wall Street financier gave away 32
billion dollars to the third world
what an incredible selfless wonderful
thing to do but spare a thought for his
children how annoyed would you be you've
done what so you're telling me the only
way I'm gonna get my inheritance now is
if I move to Africa and gates
livid
have a guess ladies gentlemen how much I
give every year to animal charities have
a guess
[Music]
that's fuckin optimistic what is exactly
right
I realized some other people said
nothing but nothing is not the same as
fuck all giving nothing to an animal
charity would be I'm sorry I forgot
fuck all is much more no I'll tell you
why do you fuck all to animal charities
it's because there are charities out
there for sick and dying children I
don't give anything to them either but
it's the principle of the thing those
are the charities I don't give to first
you know why they raise all that cash to
dig wells in Africa so when they're
finished they can throw money in a wish
for food
I know you think that's offensive but
it's not when you compare it to this the
make-a-wish Foundation
are you all familiar with the fine word
the make-a-wish Foundation do broadly
speaking they make dreams come true
for the terminally ill what could be
more worthwhile they're a great
organization I thoroughly approve of
what they do my only problem with them
is the name I think they should be
forced to change their name from the
make-a-wish Foundation
do they know make another wish we can't
do anything about that
speaking of which you will see that
heartbreaking story in the mirror
newspaper last year they run a compact
are you showing off to the other
children
are you pretending you can read by
heartbreaking story do you mean the tits
on page three
yes
so I'm fine to swing veg thank you I
presume that's what he's talking about
know so you'll hear that was a night off
for someone in there
now I talked about the make-a-wish
people as you'll see this upsetting
story in the mirror last year was about
a five year old boy that needed a new
kidney otherwise he was going to die in
the mirror ran a six-week campaign about
this yeah I'll tell you the good thing
before I tell you the funny thing about
five year old boys now six he got the
kidney and he made it thanks in no small
part to the mirror newspaper well done
then yeah we talked about heartbreak he
talked about tugging the heartstrings
last Christmas they printed his
Christmas list in the paper and the
kidney was on the list
there were things he wanted more
none of the three was a little britain
DVD i don't want to sound typhus teeth
but i de going man there you go make you
piss yourself
I'll get someone to explain what kidneys
do after this show I was at a party I
was chatting to a guy he said what does
your girlfriend do I said anything by
anal I'm joking I'm in a long-term
relationship but I'm not married does
anyone else in that situation I feel but
you're timid about saying because I like
me you'll know if you're in a long-term
relationship we're not married everyone
friends family colleagues acquaintances
everyone feels they can stir up a bit
as soon as anyone hears they go have you
thought about YouTube you thought about
an argument between us I think it's very
rude so whenever anyone says to me
before
[Music]
I could give it a go I'm not sure it's
what the relationship is missing maybe
try the shotgun
two in the pink one in the stink that's
how it was
sorry too much tubing the GU one in the
poos they're nicer for everyone
I don't know what conversation that
prompted their imagine that was you
madam turning teen thinking GLaDOS
notice you had a woman come to me after
show in Tunbridge Wells she said I found
that shocker thing very uncomfortable no
I knew what she meant but I couldn't
help myself I say to lubricant I tried
some viagra recently has anyone else
tried it
yeah well I've my honesty there sir I
tried because you can now get
over-the-counter viagra all that sounds
powerful
over the counter you say
like a fucking car
did you read the instructions when you
tried it sir you didn't I did can I take
these kind of things seriously because
it's a medication even though it's a fun
medication it's a medication nonetheless
obviously on the instructions of Micra
it says keep away from children
what kind of a man do they think I am
that can't maintain an erection with a
child
[Laughter]
the fact the child is the floor to dock
you know there's a child in a green
t-shirt you are a child I'm going yes

well that brings me very neatly on to
the next bit of material you here's got
kids kind of what's that
what sorry why'd you mean what what you
chipped in with something you said go on
Jimmy all right ironically slowing
things down
you often you don't just stop people in
the string go or employ you go
I just don't you just tell you to
continue
[Laughter]
now I don't have kids but I've got lots
of friends that have got kids there five
and six years of age I'll go run to the
house I get introduced
they say this is this is Jimmy he's a
comedian it's a bit like a clown it
isn't and the fish don't swear in front
of the kids and then they'll say would
you like to hear a joke
and then look here to go yeah I expect
you to perform so I say when I was a kid
I was scared of the dentist
you did not believe the upset come here
I'll show you
so what I've done so I've got some jokes
for kids I've rewritten some classic
children's jokes you'll know the
original shout out if you do what do you
get if you cross a sheep with a kangaroo
the jumper I've gone for a genetic
aberration that's an insult about God
and man where does the policeman live no
no no no let's be avenue exactly right
I've got for know where he's been
replaced by an under claim the poorly
equipped Community Support Officer not
that I'm having a go community support
officers they do valuable work without
them how would we know where the nearest
cash point is there's one here
[Laughter]
thanks very much you will Community
Support Officer hello how are you
you're right and where where's your beat
East London
you're a Community Support Officer in
East London you having a fucking laugh
John
I think fun is there I imagine it's
quite a good job is it so bad
so why well don't you there's some jokes
about coppers coming up remember they
don't apply to you cos you're not real
one
why is he difficult to play cards in the
jungle
those deforestation cheetahs are
actually endangered so that is quite
insensitive so what you call a donkey
with three legs just be honest with
yourselves have you got a donkey with
three legs you're gonna take a picture
on the camera phone and then melt that
fucker down what's brown and sticky Anil
this next one's a little bit different I
think it's funny which is obviously very
important but it's also educational
teaches kids about the alphabet and also
about social issues which can be very
difficult to discuss for the under-fives
why did the H kill himself because the
jihad
right lost one of these what's yellow
and dangerous shark-infested custard all
the discharge from my cock
I'm joking it's probably fine just
smells weird
I get reviewed quite a lot ladies and
gentlemen journalist come along to the
show and there write a little piece
sometimes I look at anything lost very
nice and then you'll look at it again a
few days later I think well you could
take that in two different ways I'm
gonna reason with you see if you think
I'm being paranoid the time said of this
show
he couldn't be funnier
[Laughter]
the Guardian said there's funny then
there's Jimmy Carr he's there a good
thing catch him before he gets massive I
was doing a gig up in Hull it was the
second day on the tour I was doing it
now I'm on the front of the theatre they
wrote in massive letters due to public
demand he's back for one night only
doesn't that make it sound that the
public got together and said there's
only so much of this bullshit we're
gonna stand of course we all say stupid
things from time to time I was chatting
to a friend of mine Peter were a wedding
he was trying about how much he wanted
to have children these exact words he
said we'd love to have kids but
infertility runs in my family you don't
get that I used to be sterilized
my uncle said I can't be asked to give
me prostate checked
that's a normal then like stupidity
that's so stupid it's almost brilliant
it's like those big matrix signs you get
up up the motorway to you know the ones
the big matrix signs that say this sign
is not in use when you find yourself
thinking what hang on if that's true how
do I know that well some guilty of a
fair amount of poetry myself I'm often
putting my foot in it getting it wrong I
was at the airport about six months ago
caught talking to this guy that plays
wheelchair rugby in the Paralympics I
just seen a documentary about it called
Murderball which is amazing and it
seemed a bit of it on Sky Sports so I
knew something about it we've got
chatting transpiring the conversation I
didn't know what the parrot in
Paralympics stood for oh I thought I
knew but I didn't I imagined a few of
you were in the same situation all have
a think about what the power in
Paralympics stands for stands for is not
the right term to use there
have you got something in your hands
your any guesses sparker it's definitely
not Sparkle any other guesses PG that
was my first guess it's not until you
say paraplegic Olympics out loud you
realize it's not that is it paraplegic
Olympics hang on
any other thoughts powered supers well I
they were all injured during service and
I thought we might as well that was Paul
say come on any other thoughts paralytic
yeah that's it there's nothing the
matter with in the distress
they've turned up for the Sports tag on
what 1,500 meters you have enough
fucking life on a skinful last night
I'll have a sit down you can wheel me
right no there is a legless gagging
there somewhere but we'll leave it any
other thoughts paralyzed no it's not
paralyzed either parallel parallel is
the right answer well done you gold star
it's the parent of course is the
parallel Olympics when I say it's
obvious isn't it
because it's parallel to the normal
Olympics but we shouldn't say normal
Olympics some minefield this is probably
how some of them
what is the parallel it's parallel to
the Olympics and it runs in the same
sort of City they're holding the
Olympics in it's a proper sporting event
but a couple of things while we're on
the subject if you changes someone that
plays wheelchair rugby in the
Paralympics and you've seen a bit of it
you're chatting about it you being
positive about it don't at any stage
even if you're joking
don't ever refer to it as being like the
real robot wars
he laughed but there was a definite
tension also final thing on this never
get confused between the parallel
Olympics the Paralympics and the Special
Olympics
apparently boots a proper sporting event
the Special Olympics is the one where
they're all winners although you try
telling that to the bookies when your
little fella comes in seventh
I can see some of you are shifting
uncomfortably there you're thinking can
we laugh for this sort of thing let me
just reassure you ladies and gentlemen
during that last bit no one in a
wheelchair has ever walked out
now I don't mind proper graffiti you
know gary has AIDS your mum's a bender
proper graffiti but I don't like racism
and I don't like racist graffiti and
I've started to fight back I saw a bit
of graffiti last time I was in
Felixstowe written on a wall something
to put asylum-seekers out so above here
I wrote asylum seeker zine below asylum
seeker
otherwise you'd have no ends that gave
me confidence I went back to all the
rough partner where I live in North
London someone's written on the gents
wall white power
so across the I've written Cillit bang
saw a disgraceful piece of graffiti last
time I was in stoke-on-trent someone had
written on a wall all coppers are comes
' shouldn't be possessive not about you
I saw a brilliant sign on a police
station wall it said wanted for sex
attacks I didn't know they were
vacancies
I thought I should look into that
flexible hours you get to work outdoors
you get to meet new people
speaking of violent sexual crime it was
a fella enig here that was murdering all
those prostitutes I presume you all read
about that in the papers as it was going
on really grisly morbid story but you
kind of can't look away I think some of
the reporting is that guy was murdering
loads of prostitutes whom very
irresponsible the news of the world led
with a headline the killer is out of
control now to me the headline the
killer is out of control
implicitly suggests that there is an
acceptable number of prostitutes to
murder in any given calendar month the
problem with this fucking lunatic is the
number he's killing is just not
sustainable
by this rate we will run out of
prostitutes in Ipswich area and then
will we be Newcastle
should we talk about everyone's favorite
member of the royal family
Prince Harry come on the lil ginger one
the dresses are not see that's the kind
of behavior we want from our inbred
overlords now Prince Harry was meant to
go and find a rock class here but he
couldn't go to bars for last July
because he's ginger he would melt
[Laughter]
so week ago and actually while the rest
of his unit were fighting in Basra he
was found by a British journalist
tracked down to a strip club in Canada
and the journalist went up to him and
said Hugh Prince Charles his son he said
no
[Laughter]
it got me thinking ladies gentleman
because he's just got back from
Afghanistan what kind of preparation was
that playboy lifestyle for fighting in a
war I know what you're probably thinking
about we think it'd be much clearer if
someone had juxtaposed strip clubs in
war in a poem
you're in luck I have I've compared and
contrasted strip clubs and war in a poem
it is simply entitled strip club war
yeah a little bit of culture for you
ladies yeah I will read it for you now
strip club war young men getting
slaughtered bazookas everywhere
privates standing to attention grabbing
their helmets weapons going off sobbing
men desperately clawing at gashes bodily
fluids dribble out sweethearts back at
home wondering if they'll ever see you
again the number of stiffs growing by
the hour
freshly shaven twats shooting anything
with a beer I'm regretting they'd come
the next generation spilling out of
choppers onto hot barren mounds it's
more expensive than you think it will be
when you go in and the whole thing
leaves a mess of big years to clean up
and of course Muslims don't like it
[Laughter]
[Applause]
I'd like to get to know you all as an
audience but it's difficult to get to
know a lot of people in one go there's
only one of me that's loads of you what
I've devised is a method moral dilemmas
these are questions to which there is no
absolute wrong or right answer just your
opinion tells me something about who you
are as individuals and who you are as a
group so if everyone joins in this work
so everyone say yes everyone say no
everyone say I can pick for myself
okay
right let's do a warm-up first this
doesn't count towards your final score
just a warm-up just to get you into the
spirit things but if everyone could
answer straightaway that would be great
is it acceptable to kill a whale in
order to save two pandas it's about 90%
yes I would say this evening you've
thought yeah finale of the show
although I wish are told that I'll be
fucking funny
the best response I've had to that
reasoner said is it acceptable to kill a
whale in order to save two pandas as a
moment
let them fight it out between themselves
now for better for worse this is a
question I use to judge an audience to
judge individuals if you could all
answer that would be great would you
fuck your dad to save your mum
[Music]
I don't know why you're looking subs so
it's easier for girls
he's ugly
imagine not being a fox
you're thinking yeah I would fuck my dad
please no look he's let himself go maybe
five years ago
she won't miss you mom here as well she
protects
now I've got snipers all the way around
this building
and they're pointing a gun at your
mother yeah we're gonna kill your mom's
been taken hostage she's gonna be killed
we would like you to bomb your dad yeah
of course I'm not saying you wouldn't be
coming in a softy that's fine
you say that's a toy
[Music]
sorry hang on y'all we know in Norfolk
what you booing you're booing a man
saying I wouldn't bum my dad just take
your moment to think about that all
right so you've made your decision
[Music]
Mumm Mumm
he said is that your daughter that same
question to you
I love my job
at what point did you think there's a
family this would be a good show to go
see then why that Lion King bullshit
let's bring the kids out to see a proper
show where we openly discuss incest
[Laughter]
the best response of her to that summer
one
sex education is extremely important
telling young kids about the birds and
the bees absolutely key three quick
things for a member firstly you should
know the children you tell secondly
there is a level of detail that is
considered too graphic twelve year olds
don't need to know about women and such
thirdly and perhaps most importantly you
should only ever tell them I've got a
friend that told me her new boyfriend
would like one of the Proclaimers I said
Lee Kearney either looks like both of
them or neither I like you one identical
twins stand face to face because one
identical twins stand face to face just
for a moment you think who of ours I've
got a friend that told me she was scared
of dwarves said she's scared of dwarves
are you all so scared of normal-sized
people when they're far away if you're a
dwarf and you're offended by that
I saw a documentary recently on channel
4 was all about faith and in its a
moment or a full Scientology is a
made-up religion
I thought as opposed to one of my
favorite things is to get Christians
talking about Scientology because the
Christian will go Scientologist they're
nuts as they believe in aliens and then
you can say to the Christian what are
you believing again it's a benevolent
zombie that's coming back to save you
isn't it good luck without that will
probably happen is anyone beatable fast
well fire amazing town for a friendly
place the amazing thing about Belfast
they can tell what religion you are just
from your name I went there with my
friend rabbi Lionel
give it on this if you've had an
argument with someone that you really
care about about something you couldn't
give a fuck about I had an argument with
a friend of mine that I've known for 15
years
about whether tomatoes are a fruit or
vegetables who cares
also it got me thinking can something be
both a fruit and a vegetable I mean what
if gremlin had a serious accident
I realized that it's a joke about a
homosexual man being spasticated in my
defense I did call Graham and check he
was fine without any was a fucking
awkward phone call to make Oscar Wilde
famously wrongly imprisoned
homosexuality at least that's what I
thought and then I did some further
reading turns out he was gay so fair
enough rules is rules come on you bender
people say to me you're gay
you just don't know you're gay I always
think that's gonna come as a horrible
shock it's know at some point am I just
gonna be standing around minding my own
business
[Music]
someone shouts it out the other night
day shirts I thought oh no more shirts
me fucking money in the bum I thought
was a chocolate stain
you have it on this if you have been
driving along you've hit a rabbit the
worst thing is the noise that horrible
familiar sound of a hammer in a rather
97% of all dangerous driving offenses
are committed by men you know that means
means 3% are committed by bloody women
drivers you know you are you're a
fucking menace
I don't think speed cameras are fair
who's with me
I'm driving home from this gig at 12
midnight yeah and this kids playing in
the street they've got bigger problems
than me well not anymore they're well
let's say I'm driving out from this gig
12 midnight let's say I'm do 14 in a 30
zone I get flash bought one of those
cameras how was it fair that my
girlfriend gets three points on our
licence I doesn't seem fair to me she's
already got 12 points she's going to
have to go to jail have you all seen an
incredibly powerful commercial on
television where the child of morphs
back to life having been run over
incidentally that's why you're not
allowed to leave the scene of an
accident you missed the best bit
style but clearly states if you're doing
40 miles an hour and you wear their
child there's an 80% chance that child
will die if you're doing 30 miles an
hour there's an 80% chance that child
will live here's my question where's the
ad for swerving adverts basically the
government go and watch others get in
the road slow down take the edge off we
must learn its lesson
how old did you say you want sir you're
14 years old right what's your name
Sam right let's say I'm driving you Sam
I don't know 40 miles an hour and you
run away at 10 miles an hour it's an
aggregate of 30 years now no any of you
giving yourself a chance of survival
you've also learned a little something
[Music]
you probably don't even know you okay do
you know you go you do you're fully
aware okay we've got a camera pointing
at you or anything
enjoy school

any other belief systems creationism
Croatia's is quite good that the crazies
that believe that everything was built
in seven days is it any Croatian is in
no not really my target audience people
that amazingly naive God love them or
Americans as we call them okay so a
creationist Henry the eighth Australian
accent superpower what do we go with we
I knew that you just had to think it and
I would have got it okay finally I need
something you find in the kitchen
one 1974 my kitchen a woman should I buy
tea on
[Music]
see buddy see Joseph you noise your mom
that's what we're going for there okay
right so we've got Henry the eighth
Australian accent mind-reading is a
creationist your mum should we leave it
there genuinely that is all the improv I
do that's my favourite bit that people
shout out suggestions the actual play
Bay at the end I was thinking it'd be
cute I'm always suspicious they might
just be making that up
you actually look disappointed as an
audience now I thought it was gonna be
really good the Aussie Henry the eighth
and his mum you want to get married
made you fucking mind
[Music]
it's not what sorry I forgot your mum
your mom she gave money king yeah
Oh
we are taking a bitch yes
I know you like it I can read your
fucking boy
well I've shared things our peasant for
a moment that that poor man was right my
mom not going to get fucked in this
[Music]
lucky I'm I'm much better when I've
prepared stuff ladies and gentlemen I
was asked last year to write something
about being British I thought well my
pleasure
I'd like to share it with you now what
makes Britain great is our ability to
laugh at ourselves and when s ourselves
I mean other people and when I say
laughs I mean invade
where Britain is proud to boast the
we're home to the most hard-working
diligent and adaptable workforce in
Europe the polls
oh of course you get a lot of right-wing
people saying all these poles they come
over here taking our jobs I was think if
I can't from Poland arrives he doesn't
speak the language doesn't have any
money doesn't know anyone and he takes
your job on the first day
I was doing a rest on the other day it
said on the menu all our food is made
with love I thought I know a chip shop
there shut down for doing there I was in
a restaurant with a friend the waiter
came up to take the order I said I'll
have the fish of the day
and my mate when I'm trying to lose a
bit of weight at the moment so I'm
eating porridge every day for breakfast
does anyone else see porridge for
breakfast
fucking boring I'm like four spoons in
thinking this is actually depressing I
wouldn't mind dying
I was so bereft of stimulus when I was
eating my breakfast the other day I read
the box of porridge genuinely says on
the box of porridge no I did colouring
no but it's grain what do they think I
think they might be adding extra gray
a lot of people don't approve of size
zero models than they're called
fat people folly percent of toddlers are
overweight and they're called waterless
I've got a friend she recently went to
her GP just for the annual checkup
she was classified by her own GP as
being morbidly obese who came up with
our term that's so unnecessarily harsh
morbidly obese
sounded sympathetic and then it turns
out was another joke about a big fat
funny of course he goes the other way
too
I've got another friend that just lost
six stone why say she lost six stone she
lost a leg to diabetes
still go girl slowly and carefully
because there is no need to go on to die
if anyone's thinking of going on a diet
there's no need all you've got to do
here's the secret have a photo of
yourself taken holding up a pair of
enormous house doesn't matter how big
you why everyone thinks you've made a
tremendous effort job done it was a shot
from the side as well always with a
really smug expression of look what a
fat cunt I was of course there are some
clothes out there as to why we're
getting bigger as a nation Domino's
Pizza is a very good clue very simple
business supply and demand very simple
if we demand something they will supply
they're happy to they now make a double
decker Pizza how'd it happen
people must have been phoning up going
through those abdominals yes how can I
help you what would you like is a
top-end
of the five fruit and veg women to eat
every day I think you know you're fat if
you count jaffa cakes should we talk
about Gillian McKeith the woman from you
are what you eat
begging the question what did you eat
the witch from rent-a-ghost
some kid what my guess some people don't
I think she's a fucking disgrace because
what does she do for a living she
humiliates women shakes a middle-aged
woman who's let herself go but she's a
bit plump big boned he's not a danger to
shipping he's not hurting anyone that
she's humiliates her on national
television initially she goes this is
what you eat in a week you love the safe
fat cow you can see it in a beady little
eyes this is what you eat in a week is
anyone noticed how that table of food
she shows the big fat fatty he's exactly
the same as the one Kerry Katona's shows
us all in the Iceland
and then the piece to resist us shooting
to this what like it's the most natural
thing of all she goes she's into this
then she's got the audacity it was a
brass neck of a woman to go your booze a
bit smelly he's made of shit Gillian
I think I may have solved this riddle
the reason that is a little bit tricky
is it just fell out of our ass
it's still warm you fucking maniac most
people that get cosmetic surgery are
disappointed with the results but they
look pleasantly surprised
you ever got mixed up between car
booting and docking
it's embarrassing isn't it I paid 50
Peter fuck a guy's wife dogging all pay
and display as I like to call it or
park-and-ride makeup sex is amazing
after you've had an argument with
inappropriate if you've had a fight with
the traffic warden women get annoyed
when men used to last the toilet paper
to get an order of our ladies so what
I've done is I've stopped like my arts
and still she's upset and women in fact
used twice as much toilet paper as men
which is fair enough they've got double
the number of bottles I quite like that
as a term for a woman or a lady I like
the term
no to bombs yes one of the back has
distributional another law father on the
front little fellas may be the wrong
term to use me I'll use it in a sentence
I was on holiday with my double booked
we were in Thailand we were having a
little bit of lunch in a cafe on the
beach she said I'm just gonna go for a
pee I'll be back in a minute she was
back almost immediately she said I
couldn't go was disgusting
my question is Sybil has that ever
happened to a man in history the world
ever let's face it fellas if we're going
for a peace he's gonna have the gins
could be a pile of rotting corpses yeah
hi the worst you're gonna get from a
bloke is you want to breathe through
your mouth in there
[Laughter]
she said a weird thing to me recently
she said she wanted to wear a blindfold
during sex I thought well fine on the
one hand you want to take away one of
your senses in order to heighten the
other four in order to increase the
erotic pleasure of lovemaking let's keep
that and go sounds fun on the other hand
I was thinking what you're really saying
is I will fuck you you don't have to
cover my own men proposed on their knees
do you know why that is it's to get them
used to asking for sex when they're
married on you women like to dance with
men because women instinctively know if
they dance with a man they'll be able to
tell what he's like in the bedroom
and it is quite a good indicator I tend
to dance for about thirty seconds I have
a bit of a crime
the feeling you're laughing at me not
with me it's very cruel I've read an
article recently about British men's
ultimate sexual fantasy and it surprised
me the result of it surprised me it was
a proper server there are 3000 men their
opinion
I've actually do a little straw poll in
here this evening because the results of
this I'm shocked ultimate sexual
fantasies has anyone got one they
wouldn't mind admitting to Jessica but
it's a specific person who you would
like to bone well I happen to know
Jessica Alba there's an awful lot of
work for charity my girlfriend
my girlfriend is your ultimate sexual
fantasy yes people see my girlfriend and
they see me and they say she's only
going out with you because you're famous
and I say what's your point is that your
girlfriend your girlfriend I'm not gonna
smoke
am I just clarify you are a beautiful
lady no disrespect to you where he had
called I had to put him down the only
way to get to him was through you as
well I suggest you go for him wasn't
good-looking enough Manuel Flores yeah
you'll be using those hands later on
when you
any other ultimate sexual fantasies
Viking helmet
we've got two vaginas
any other ultimate sexual fantasies
schoolgirl and then you've pointed at
your man I think we've got we've got a
special term for a schoolgirl fantasy
now we call it feed oh sorry so do you
like what do you like the schoolgirl
teacher schoolgirl really you know if
this precious time for the schoolgirl
you know it's no it's good look at the
positive you get to be on a list that's
nice
everyone in the neighborhood knows where
you live that's convenient isn't it do
you make a dress up as a schoolgirl
he's too young
easy-easy let's just think this through
cuz bestiality a lot of people just
write off as a terrible thing let's look
at both sides let's say you fuck account
and that could happen let's imagine you
fucking care you haven't actually harmed
the cow cows are fucking enormous you're
not going to with your tiny cock you
know but you've probably distress the
animal Daisy's probably thinking on the
upside though you've had a whale of a
time and if you have a baby with account
it'll be a minor bully from bull's eye
he's putting into terms he'll understand
any other alternate sexual fantasies an
amputee
it's no pull Mikami's out come see
we're the Paul McCartney because there
is Paul McCartney he's a national
treasure a global icon he was in the
vehicles and he couldn't find a woman
with full working lives I see you got to
make do people actually actually she
accused him I believe of hitting her
which is I'm a GP key hitter do you
thinking here do you think Paul
McCartney here abdominals I don't think
he did but I mean if I'm honest I would
have taken violence against women in any
way shape or form but it'd be
interesting to know whether she would
spin round like a swinging ball and
actually to be she accused him of
hitting her with her false leg that is
disgraceful and that is a lie I can tell
you why that is definitely alive because
if you hit someone with a false leg
technically that is a kick
the reason I mention this is because in
this article it said that the most
common ultimate sexual fantasy ultimate
sexual fantasy remember in the UK is to
have two women at the same time got me
thinking well I mean I'm not saying it
wouldn't be fun to have two women at the
same time it is thank you show business
I'd be if I wasn't a comedian
I just think if it's your ultimate
sexual fantasy you're only limited by
your imagination to women at the same
time is a bit lame you can have anything
you want you can have a woman with 15
tits riding a unicorn across a rainbow
therefore mine two women at the same
time I mean at least at the very least
go for three cuz think about how much
better would it be having sex with two
beautiful attractive women if you were
safe in the knowledge all the while you
were fucking them there was another one
outside washing the car would make it
just a little bit better wouldn't it I
told my girlfriend my ultimate sexual
fantasy was to have two of them at the
same time and she agreed but then she
was livid when I told her she was
neither she was gonna be the one outside
washing the car I did have a threesome
once this was many years ago about eight
nine years ago I've seen this girl it
transpired she had a twin so I asked you
don't ask you don't get i asked i got
there's a lesson in life
it was fucking brilliant one of the best
experiences of my life because if
anything a twin was better-looking than
her and an all-round great guy
yeah you knew something was coming but
you didn't realize it was gonna be her
brother in her are there people in from
the west country going I don't really
get it no I love my job I love telling
jokes to people but essentially what I
do for a living I'm a jester I'm a clown
I'm a fool sometimes I want to be taken
a bit more seriously so I'd like to take
a five-minute timeout from telling you
jokes and I'd like to throw some ideas
at you some thoughts that I've had
ladies gentleman there to help me with
this I'm gonna bring on a trio of jazz
musicians what I am I can I get some
jazz musicians please thanks very much
appreciate it
these aren't jokes ladies young I'm just
gonna throw some ideas at you so balls
that I've had right imagine ladies and
gentlemen imagine we're sitting in a
cafe on the left banks of the Seine you
know one of those smoky cafés were
smoking blue wires were drinking
absinthe we're just chatting shooting
the breeze ladies and gentlemen just
talking about love and life and ideas
thoughts yeah not just jokes ideas yeah
let's have a little bit of a little bit
of juice just to set the mood yeah
maybe a little bit of atmosphere a
little bit of mystery so it's like it
kind of smoky cafés smooth
yeah a smoky caffeine I carefully where
there's a too fat for
I know I had the mill since you comes to
the fire
what happens if you spill carpet cleaner
if an amnesiac got our Simon's would
they forget they couldn't remember
anything
what size do you think the Queen's bed
if you walk backwards in flip-flops
they forfeit
venison's dear isn't it the gypsies ever
gone caravanning holidays
I'll ask
the Asterix cartoon character
Asterix I wonder how rude is his real
name
if you were a necrophilia pedophile
there was into bestiality would you fuck
homeless
Church is a depressing I mean why builds
all of them in graveyards my local
church is raising money for a giant
thermometer
you know the best cure for depression
suicide
the Great Barrier Reef is all very well
but he doesn't seem to be keeping the
Australians in
consider the positive you never alone
with schizophrenia if you're
schizophrenic and you're offended by
that you can both
sometimes it's self-service restaurants
or buffets I tip myself
bad enough of a spider lays its eggs
underneath your skin and they hatch out
worse if it's a goose
if you're nine months premature
you just disdain when someone says I
hear voices I always think that were
your ears I was thinking what is it that
separates us from the animals
I'm not superstitious but I heard about
this guy that fell after the 13th floor
window of the building and he died
[Laughter]
I've had an idea for a shop selling used
artificial limbs it's called the
second-hand secondhand store a shoehorn
sounds like the kind of thing I thought
fetishes might get
I'm writing a book on dream
interpretation it's all you find too
much cheese
why did you please call it a funfair
when it's clearly neither a snail can
travel over a razor blade without
cutting itself or to put it another way
sometimes scientists get bored women
blink twice as much as men
brilliant think of all the stuff we can
get away with I was very disappointed
when I went to wet and wild
it's a watermark we English you're no
good at foreign languages until we go
abroad where English is a foreign
language
what was the best thing before sliced
bread bread knife no massive sandwiches
if I had an opticians I'd make them do
the shop sign in a blurry font
no man is an island said the other man
I'd like to get another tattoo Ivan got
tattoo
so were you like about pacifists
it's always darkest just before dawn and
we call that nighttime
Travel lucky slogan is nothing like a
good night's sleep
there's a thin line between obsessive
and compulsive it's a - I was gonna
leave my body to science and then I
thought no I'll leave it to Java
[Music]
why do you never hear about anyone being
given five months to live some men never
tell their dads that they love them and
I guess that's just because they're not
going
people have skeletons in the closet and
gay men come out of the closet
cheating the gay men are coming out the
closet as a scare the skeletons
Confucius said how do you know you're a
man dreaming you're a butterfly are not
a butterfly dreaming you're a man I
don't know not a butterfly i Brophy at
what scientists have discovered a cure
for the fear of flying 22 hours on a
coat
I went to see a hypnotist show and I
really enjoyed it
which made me suspicious right final
thoughts I had an out-of-body experience
I was beside myself
might be a good sign now as we as we
clear away our jazz trio God love you
for that was lovely and same will got
any questions for me anyone got any
haven't got a criminal record yes most
rapes in an hour
I'm gonna take a pointy lady the less
time to forget you you know it's a big
deal for me recording a DVD I thought
I'd take a little photo yeah go on once
she likes you watching her pain so sorry
a question I get asked that every show
it's weird that you would ask that so
because she likes a lot of people to
watch your teeth and is that your thing
you like people to what you paid well
clearly yes he didn't say that for that
reason did it remember earlier when you
said he was a feeder for making you
dress up as a schoolgirl I think he
might be payback time but surely you
could just dress her as a schoolgirl I
never do all we own you that's plays
into your whole pedo fantasy everyone's
happy apart from anyone with any sort of
sense of taste and decency frankly
horrified by you - what's your name sir
Sam I said well sorry Souths well yeah
definitely I need a surname for this I'm
not in charge of the register don't
worry
so what he said about being watched P
that you enjoy you just tell us we're
all interested to know what you do so
why is he like
[Laughter]
[Applause]
yes once you've you know once you've
been with someone there's a level of
intimacy that suggests that you would be
able to pee in front of them or well
maybe my chest
but some people are like us baby
some people don't think in the way
they're closed-minded they've got a
sense of I don't know appropriate
occasion we're not taking this for oh no
we are lovely golden showers what card
order I don't actually drive a car sir I
roll in
[Music]
any other questions thoughts what's my
favorite type of cheese knob
the best plays are performed to say a
new girlfriend
[Applause]
so a headline in the paper it said man
held after rape they totaled
I called the rape helpline Center they
suggested I bought balaclava
PC has gone mad you can't say Siamese
anymore so I guess my cat is a conjoined
twin
speaking of hilarious birth defects did
you all read about that little girl born
in India with eight limbs incredible she
was born into a Hindu family so they
thought she might be the reincarnation
of a goddess now a spider but the test
for that is pretty simple they just pop
them in a bath and see if they can get
it on their own how annoyed would you be
if you got home and your partner said to
you I've got HIV
I like to try and see the silver lining
I see the world through rose-tinted
glasses I think it's because of this job
even something as awful as the AIDS
epidemic
I like two big maids in my little head
as a massive game of dairy aids
gotcha
chase me
sorry I don't understand homophobic all
the homosexuals are fucking ourselves
and why not it's a bloody good laugh lot
of Americans are still bizarrely touchy
about the twin towers but you have to
accept seven years on is we needed a new
Wembley
do you think that's offensive wait for
this I've had an idea for a money-making
scheme twin tower Jenga that's not even
in the film work is when one of the
towers collapses you shout gee I saw my
bin Laden say what you like about the
man he is world hide-and-seek champion I
was out in town earlier I saw a disabled
toilet someone had written on it out of
order I thought I know what disabled
means
[Laughter]
when I was a kid I was never scared of
the Daleks I used to be spooked out by
the Daleks but whatever that come on I
just go well if they ever came here
I just go upstairs they can't get me if
I go upstairs well now when I watch
Doctor Who I'm petrified because of all
the wheelchair access we put in
everywhere they can go anywhere they
fucking line now we're frankly we're
sitting ducks it would be remiss of me
ladies and gentlemen
not to talk to you all about the
environment because that is the big
issue which is upset the homeless no end
a carbon footprint is a metaphor for the
mark you leave on the earth as you walk
through your lives of course I don't
have one
because I Drive everyone and these twice
as bad if you're Christian because
you've got Jesus traipsing alongside
I don't think they should have called it
global warming I think they should have
called it earth toasty will planet
snuggles just all sounds too nice
doesn't it if we don't do something now
we could end up as snug as a bug in a
rock fine affect global warming
seriously but you know what can you do
I'm driving everywhere it twice the
speed so we get there in half the time
and I've stopped eating foxes glass here
means I tell you who I feel sorry for
when there's flooding in the UK I feel
sorry for the fire brigade because they
get 5000 phone calls a day when this
flooding going who saw the fire brigade
my house is under water yeah we're
already trained for that that's almost
the opposite of what we do for a living
you want to give us a buzz back if it
catches light
okay bye-bye teni who annoys me when
there's flooding the guy in the high
street in a canoe every bit of news
footage there's a guy in the high street
in a canoe going have you not got a
canoe have you got a car I've got you
know
who's that smug twice and where the fuck
is he going I'm off to boot
[Laughter]
I've never been in a canoe I should
really write a joke about a gay dinosaur
dancer
women usually take care of contraception
within a relationship but some men do
and they're called
dance
I'm not sure about abortions being
available three months into pregnancy I
think they should be available right the
way up to GCSEs I like the phrase
performed in abortion
do you think anyone's ever gone
[Music]
a lot of people are worried that the
artificial creation of sperm in
laboratories means that men are
essentially obsolete now women don't
need men anymore because they can
artificially create sperm in
laboratories what do you think about
that ladies
luckily they keep the artificially
created sperm in jam jars so you still
need us to
I'm not sure if that's exactly
artificial insemination works you get
the gist
there's nothing wrong about gist you're
making your own jokes now my girlfriend
said to me recently we can't have sex
I've got a headache
I said I'm gonna be right to the other
end if you want to get back to me if you
get a penny of vajayjay that's right I
said betrayed you
I've got an awkward question for you
it's all good whether you're here on a
first day or whether you're in a
long-term relationship it's all good for
everyone should you spit or swallow
following oral sex
that's a local question it's pretty much
the cutting edge of sexual politics I'm
gonna solve this out that you want some
for all you'll never have to think about
it again ladies and gentlemen should you
spit or swallow following oral sex it
doesn't matter
one savage a culated I'm asleep you can
do what you fucking like you can gargle
the national anthem for all I care
as long as he doesn't wake me up or
interfere with you calling you can
[Music]
sorry that was misleading she swallowed
that was the deaf girl I was fucking
if you've got their friends if you've
got their friends you should never do
the death force just say things like
that
it's pretty much group tonight to the
death if you really want to fuck with
their friend say things online because
then they know you're saying something
bla bla bla bla bla bla bla
bla bla how was the death girl in that
joke using the phone
if you're deaf or you're offended by
anything you've heard I'm gonna leave
you with this ladies gentlemen it's been
a pleasure told you I'm gonna leave you
with a story about shouting out I like
it when people shout out when they join
in in life whether it's a comedy show or
just out in the world I was at a tennis
match
eight years ago watching Tim Henman play
I'm a big fan of to amendment any time
he wins a point he pretends to mind to
meet you
they're only midgets in I didn't see you
but then that is part of your charm this
guy behind me in the stools shout
something Brittany now he waits until
tim hemmond walking into our visas ilton
kabylie water you know the way they do
have about ten games ago so we're just
walking into his little drinking this
guy shots Tim Tim there's a bit of shoot
at the end of Rockies and of logos no
veins
so brilliant job this it's lovely you
spend an hour and a half talking to
people telling them jokes building up
this reservoir of goodwill but then
you're as pretty just to fuck off it's a
bit weird with your permission I'd like
to piss away some of that goodwill you
know sometimes I'll tell a joke that's a
bit edgy and I feel as an audience you
go oh that's a little bit close to that
your menu what you like I'd like to tell
one now they'll make you go would you
like to hear it well it's a joke about
love can love conquer all order the
practicalities of life get in the way
what a great example of this is May to
December relationships relationships
where there's a bit of an age gap can
love conquer that divide or does life
get in the way the practicalities it's
probably as many different opinions as
there are people in this room here's my
opinion for what it's worth I think you
know what girl is too young for you if
you're having to make the aeroplane
noise to get your cock in her mouth
[Music]
[Music]
there's three things I like to vote joke
firstly I like the fact it's a bit edgy
I like edgy jokes
it's about as edgy as I'd want to be
second thing I like about it next time
you're being intimate with your
partner's I know you saw that thinking I
think he's a bit too mature for that
he's thinking thing I like about that
joke probably later on tonight maybe
tomorrow the next day someone's gonna
say to you who you were at a comedy show
tell us a joke
I guarantee you that is all you're gonna
be able to think and you'll fuck yeah I
was fucking old in the face
[Music]
I spend a lot of my life driving around
the country doing gigs and I'm often
driving back late at night I don't know
how you feel about it but I always pick
up hitchhikers if I see a hitchhiker
I will pick them up they always say the
same thing to me they always say I don't
live in the woods
I'd like to end this evening by talking
about heckling I like a bit of heckling
it's great fun when people have come to
see your show and they feel they can
join it's like everyone's friends it's
great
but when you start out in this business
oh my god it can be cruel
I've got friend that was doing the
support act obviously if you're doing a
support act people haven't paid to see
you they're paid to see someone else and
you were sort of getting in their way
his friend of mine he's a very funny boy
he was supporting a very famous comedian
in Oxford and someone from the back of
the room as he was halfway through his
act and he was struggling fair enough
but he didn't need this halfway through
that someone shouted you're ruining our
evening
fucking hell
oh there happens to me all the time
happened a couple of weeks ago a guy
sitting where you're sitting there sir
front and center he's phone went off now
everyone's got a mobile phone
someone's gonna leave it on by mistakes
not the end of the world just switch off
not a problem
he took the call sends me in 2000 people
going what the fuck is this guy on he
Tony confidently he went I'm a comedy
show then there was a pause and he went
no really
I'll leave you this it has been a
pleasure talking to you ladies gentlemen
I leave you this this is the harshest
heckle I've ever had to deal with I was
doing a gig in Edinburgh late in life
doesn't start til one o'clock in the
morning so they're all out of their
minds on heroin the short
okay so it's a late-night gig everyone's
drunk and high and out of their minds
and and it's all going quite well I'm
about ten minutes into the gig and then
you know to my usual things about eight
years ago it's pretty new to this game
and this time from the side shouts very
clearly loudly confidently just as I'm
halfway through a joke my mum died of
