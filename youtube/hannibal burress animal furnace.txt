so he mailed to promoter to say man was
so witness to putting the microphone in
his ass and he wrote me back and said
don't worry microphone an ass guy brings
his own microphone
as he bring his own microphone but I'm
sure this started out like that probably
citizen complaints from other performers
hey man I don't want to be a DVD thing
but this guy's is totally asked out the
microphone so is that way to get a spare
microphone or is there something we
could spray on the microphone to make
your uh Nass I'm not used to working
like this man this is not why I got in
the music business they were put on the
live show every show the lead from the
band would say the garbage can for the
bar garbage and brought on ahead of his
drum and then someone just keep drumming
with garbage on his body
my favorite show was a monster out
during that somebody else from the crowd
took the garbage can
all for the Troma's head put it on his
own I don't know why he did that because
immediately after somebody else in the
crowd bust him in his garbage can
and he fell to the ground bloody not
tell you what happened that's because
when you put a garbage can on yeah it
lives up with your vision
about a hundred percent
leaving you very open so those type of
attacks that's why I never put garbage
cans on my head it's always neat to know
what's going on around me and I can't
maintain that level of awareness with a
garbage can on my head I just know
myself like that
I feel bad for the guy cuz it happened
so fast he didn't get that so having a
garbage counter this area
this new consecutive thoughts well
become I mean I regret putting that
garbage down on my hand I was a whore
why I did something I just shows the
colleges some signs and when I do a
college show I do an interview with the
school paper and a result could be a
horrible article so I want to share with
y'all this article my gig I did at
Eastern Illinois University in
Charleston Illinois this is all real and
in print a human being wrote this
and then they sent it to a higher
ranking you were big an editor and that
person said yeah just go with that
oh what a bow is set the naps immediate
helps bring diversity to campus
we're home responses we're bringing
diversity to your canvas because you
realize the type of diversity outbreak
is very temporary because I'm leaving as
soon as I get my second sound sucks
actually baby before this show
it was a full interview and sometimes
when I do fall interviews and the
journalist is born I just started saying
crazy stuff it's making fun for me and
make the most out of my time and she
said what do you talk about in your
comedy I said I'll talk about the
streets this performances include
comedic jokes little wit comedic jokes
as opposed to all the other types of
jokes get out there I'm missing out on
the town would I hate to have to be the
reason I don't make it big the Hannibal
Buress could have been huge but he focus
all this energy out community jobs
you know with so many other cycling
jokes out they really pigeon-holed
themselves you know something bitter old
man committing any comedians they focus
on all types of esoteric soaks it sucks
of our past here is me only did comedic
zones these young dudes man cousin
fathers will comedic jokes later the
personal stories turn advanced the
streets
you know what I take the blame for that
I said that on the record take the blame
he's performance comedic tosylates or
personal stories current events the
streets and even food he said the game
right now
nobody says Hannibal Burres that's all
he is caught at that subject matter he
is the Lenny Bruce of grocery store
humor
he is so edgy you should have saw when
he was in Dallas Texas half the crowd
walked out when it did its new bit about
lettuce it was crazy
Matt captain dare the University comedy
for disea burst was picked because he
stood out more than other choices he
stands out like an exclamation point
Catherine as said I don't know if that's
weird a borderline racist that's going
weird weird cuz I think it's weird to
compel people to punctuation na I think
he's more like the semicolon comedian
very semicolon like and delivery named
Payson my calling sir this day I use a
comma every time hey you know what if I
email somebody to get upset about me
using a comma instead of a semicolon
that's not a person I want to work with
anyway and that's how you we people out
of your life
Paris was the most popular community
capitals price range of $2,000
there's a couple years ago some things
about that
you goddamn right I was hell yeah
I was ruling that price range in the
Midwest two years ago thank you is that
this she called her aunt had want to
make this article more tacky that vini
ideas well maybe you could miss the
amount of money he's making for myself
nothing sort of article but forget the
added bonus of putting this business out
there and make it harder them insurance
board I'd the future
water tank that's your food
- IRRI said he also big burns because he
his african-american was adding more
diversity to the comedic line of this
semester he's a black comedian so it
makes a crowd more diverse and everyone
gets what they want
compromise
everyone that's a weird thing to say I
even be with it didn't it's it is so
heady Seabrook Hannibal Burres yeah we
booked by coming to the show
no I'm not coming to the show but I
everybody gives what they want when I
come to town town morale
EEGs is that all time high everybody's
happy they go to the local grocery
stores are stuck on the high does no
insensitive buying
[Music]
go through the lattice bit I don't know
that even going to the service Happy's
here
I got a jaywalking ticket in Montreal I
couldn't believe it
I've say walk so many times in my life
it's such an easy thing to time out is
that car coming nah let me get across
there
I've done it thousands of times but this
time it was me and his old lady we would
say walking together he wants to gather
like that but if we were so what my
business I just met y'all
so menace old lady we get across the
street that a Montreal cop approaches us
speaking in French
[Music]
French
I said hey man I don't talk like that
that's not how I talk can you talk to me
how I talk
I probably wasn't the best way to start
off my interaction but my phone is made
of language but who cares
I take risk in life I said sorry about
that and I tried to keep going about my
day because I thought that's how
jaywalking was handled as a crime my bad
we're done here right that's it I
acknowledge that I'd say walk I
apologize now for the act that they walk
about how my jaywalker made you feel
trying to say walk in the future while
you're watching but trust imma do it the
rest of my life is the best way to go
about being a pedestrian
to give you a ticket give me your ID I
said you don't understand all they get
people might be for real stuff this is
not real this is a fantasy crime that
sure enforces to cover up the fact that
the city is having financial problems
right now
the city is broke and it puts you out
here with a quota that's fine I will
donate 60 of your colorful last dollar
see a broke-ass City
let's just do it like that no paperwork
and it's good guess what two more cops
show up now we have three months three
all police officers working this
high-profile jaywalking case three cops
to me and say Walker fair enough I
decided to do the sound I was gonna talk
trash to the cops standing closest to me
cuz I don't like him or what he
represents Sarge just wants to mess with
him and say whatever I could say to
master them cuz he's wasting my sound so
I say hey man how much money do you make
a year was the douchey thing to do three
cops working today Walken ticket that's
overkill only have two legs that's a pop
and a half per leg that's a waste of
city funds that's why this city is
broken now and he told me how much he
made I don't know why he told me he
didn't have to tell me if he said how
much do you make can I tell him he got
upset and he said what do you say of
race what
[Music]
we was the first two guesses ladies do
this to herself to the legal people love
buying super rules from he's a
charismatic guy said a hell out of a car
those the only two times an oversized
police office I'm a dumb guy my
worldview is limited
when I say hey man your colleague he's
50 years old and he's right jaywalking
tickets for a living is he considered a
failure as a police officer that seemed
like some stuff that you should be doing
he was upset about that he's trying to
hold it and he was upset but I could
tell he was upset because the next thing
he said was oh you're cool
I said no I'm not a cool guy you're a
cool guy he said yeah I'm a cool guy
says doing cool stuff trying to be cold
I said man cool people never say shit
like that they gave me a $37 ticket for
jaywalking and the $444 tickets just for
being an ass but that's how much it
costs it's being asked the Montreal
police that's the case you pricing it
out for your next vacation but don't
worry don't worry about me I'm not
paying either of the missing Canada it
doesn't count to me it's now real
I was at the airport it was this kid
four or five years old walking with this
mommy fixed his fingers and a fake gun
and then took a shot at me now I'm
looking at the wall to see if there's
something in the wall he could've been
shooting there cuz I'm gonna deny I look
back at him he looks me in my eyes it
takes two more shots
don't hit three times thousand active
aggression I have to defend myself I'm a
man before now a point blank space suit
this kid right here everybody's company
my other airport nemesis is f1 security
I don't like them at all they seem so
dedicated to keep them bottled water out
of the sky
that's the main thing it's probably easy
to get coke Hannibal playing than a
bottle of water probably all the way if
you couldn't get cocaine on the planet
they looked at it so water stirs water
most okay go right ahead
because of terrorists try to liquid bomb
thing that nobody could bring link was
sort of playing one person mess it up
for everybody but I feel like that's
being reactive instead of proactive
because terrorists always trying new
stuff so next time is gonna be some type
of Snickers bar after that happens you
can't bring full-size Snickers on the
plant anymore I'm gonna bring minutes of
Snickers one person messed it up for
everybody now you have security trying
to negotiate the sneaker situation
that's about the same size as the
full-size Snickers security that's me
I'm just hungry stop yelling at me
bring the bottle water sir
why man is not by water what if I set
the water to show you that is not by
water what if this if I wasn't such a
good supply why he's better sitting
right now
one that is stopping for additional
screening but the only scrutiny they rub
the cloth on my hands and then he went
attested they came back and say all
right you could okay cool
good thing I didn't have bomb juice on
my hands since I got the bomb juice test
what if I did have bomb juice on my
hands what if one of my friends
Hannibal before you go to the airport
you want to hold a bomb real quick
[Laughter]
baby bear
that's pretty cool thanks man
when I get to the airport they test my
hands they say you have bombs you see
your hands is there anything you'd like
to tell us yeah one of my friends he got
a bunch of bombs and he said you want to
hold a bomb real quick before you go to
the airport I never had a bomb before so
I thought it'd be something cool to do I
made sure not to bring the bomb with me
because I know y'all ate that
so I want to just hold a bottle cuz I
think you need to chill out
and stop being jealous cuz I got all
types of friends some of my friends all
bombs and let me hold of you need to
open up your social circle and meet some
new people I hate when they try to make
conversation with me are you going to
New York for business or pleasure I'm
going to New York but talk about you in
front of strangers
I live in New York there's a lot of
dudes in my neighborhood I have
handlebar mustaches which is cool if you
want to have a handlebar mustache but
don't try to have a conversation with me
like you don't have a handlebar
moustache try to talk about regular
stuff like music and politics nah dude
you got a handlebar mustache I don't
want to talk about it slinkys and kazoos
that's it talk about the shoes for a few
minutes you go hop on unicycling juggle
maybe for some clothes restore and
mustache ooh-hoo
energy mustache you the Hannibal pirate
story
so one night I was out it was 5:00 in
the morning having some drinks was
talking with this girl I decided to take
a swing I say how about we go back to my
place for some food some drinks most
women would say yeah that sounds cool
no I'm alright what she said was what
type of food we talking about
motorcycle shrinks are we talking about
and do you expect me to have sex with
you I'll come back to your place if you
come back to my place at 5:00 in the
morning and all my food and drink all my
drinks and you don't want to have sex
and I don't want you in my life at all
let's have a person to do something like
that it sounds like something a
sociopath to do told me a place keeps
the food shaky drinks leave at 6:30 good
life is poor as a passive part
as soon as she said that I said o'clock
this woman was crazy but I was kind of
drunk I went and she's kind of quirky
it's kind of quirky weird so we talked
full of it she says stuff I say stuff
she says stuff I say stuff you know how
compensation works
I think it's going well I'm going for
the kiss she says what you think you can
says kiss me western men and men in
general think they're inside us whatever
they want from women you upset the fire
she started going on this weird feminist
rent it's fine if you want to be a
feminist but I think 5:00 in the morning
after the bar closes is a weird time at
some point is soapbox
yes 5:00 in the morning everybody wants
to that's why they stayed out till 5:00
because it didn't happen at the soup
so we keep talking for some reason she
wants to know my address she showing
interest I tell her the address then we
won't go lose her just once know the
address plus the cross street and she
text it to herself after I tell I say
what's wrong she says I have to be safe
three out of ten women that get raped
don't report I said one out of one dudes
is walking away from the table assassin
and she said what's wrong said you a
crazy person that's what's wrong and
right now sounds kind of risky to hang
out with you and I didn't notice about
myself in such a day but I don't hang
out with anybody that quotes rape
statistics there's nobody in my life cuz
does that is such a weird trait to have
I'm a black man in Scotland on a work
visa you talking about rape they don't
believe any bullshit you say
but super drunk women can't handle
rejection she was Chinese please let me
explain oh you've explained enough with
your words how about why I was wrong you
are insane lady that's what's wrong
I just want to educate people this is a
weird-ass time for that type of class go
away lady give me 30 seconds to explain
no I don't want it solves don't please
stop walking away get away from you away
with my exile that feel real drag no use
now
I like the drink by only like a drink
with people that can hold their lip good
I was out with this girl I bought some
drinks to go back to my hotel room she
starts throwing up the drinks that I
bought on my hotel room
it was very upset is like she was
throwing up my money my money
Miriam says those so many levels really
not that many levels people overuse that
it was messed up on so many levels man
I'm thrilled
why don't you name the levels level
three by the physical I love a shut up
man you can't surprise

the stands to my hotel there was this
man walking down the stairs this man
started throwing up down the stairs

somebody if they do wrong
[Applause]
my state-sponsored is all
I do tax diapers give me $40 on your
left shoe that's the bomb attacks you
suck drink some water and go to bed it
really upset me as this man was 40 years
old at least
and if you forty I don't think you
should be throwing up from alcohol they
will just know your lemons man have a
family and a mortgage you had this
wonderful father you spit Cynthia's son
something 28 I've been throwing for my
father seven years because whatever
further urge to throw up I'm able to
channel that energy out into because I'm
a goddamn warrior I'm an urban warrior
and I mean I mean I live in the city
that urban to me black how white people
use it
oh I don't believe in cancer walks well
I believe in them because they exist
I'd rather just give money straight up
and save my Saturday afternoon

setup please I don't think here's a
response to have five people work
I don't think Kansas City no how many
people walk how many people walk out far
away in the same side that's crazy I'm
out of here
