socks on the one
many people come to man they say hey how
can you be such as swinging sex dog what
I fail you it's not the because I can to
make a lot of up to one time in that
it's not the big cause I say Oh things
that woman wants to hear like are you
through yet
it's because I know how to read woman if
she is like a captain I have kitty
litter
[Music]
[Applause]
if she is like a dog we do it on the
paper
but I'm also a unique kind of guy the
kind of guy who likes to have his own
special sale not to smell like every
other guy I like to have my own in that
vidual older that's why our tuna fish
I put food on the fish sandwich under
each arm maybe one or two behind the
ears
I don't smell like and of all their guys
and it's economical too because the
smell lasts for four or five days
[Music]
many people come to me and they say hey
what kind of girl is it you want to mean
what I'll tell you I just want to meet a
girl with a head on her shoulders
I hate necks
[Applause]
when we go to a fence at restaurant and
I walk in with her ever ahead terms
except her she has no neck
[Applause]
hey grandpa bought a rubber and now it's
time for Charlie
I know what you're saying you're saying
oh I bet this guy can't juggle

[Applause]
hey it's a muppet hi boys and girls now

fish towel okay
everyone should have one you get the
Muppets here aren't they cute
so they taped that show in London it's
so much fun to do it they fly you over
for free so it's like a paid vacation so
I went to London I was so close to Paris
I decided to go over there so I saw
London and I saw France
and then I saw someone's Underpants how
many people have plans to go to France
raise your hand okay now listen
if you're going to France let me give
you a warning in France
chapeau means hat Ruth means treat it's
like those French have a different word
for everything
they do it to screw you up I'm not
kidding down I speak English I studied
English for about 2 or 3 years and I
think I've lost my accent completely I
could think I could speak English very
very well
Milan over there thinking English will
be fine because it's a universal
language and everyone speaks it's like
it off the plane getting in the taxi you
say to the driver I'd like to go to a
hotel please the driver turns those
number three let's do the bus wah so the
first thing you do this is really dumb
you adopt a French accent because you
think that will help I would like to go
to the hotel
that's nothing so I went out and bought
a little French phrase book hoping to
memorize French but the French is not
like Spanish Spanish is easy for
Americans you can kind of sound it out
Casa de Pape a donde esta Casa de Pepe
but French is like you know a little
wall
[Music]
this boat fruits is dead
[Applause]
but I started yet I have okay then let's
go
I think
[Music]
I'm getting Legionnaires disease
[Applause]
I think the most memorable experience I
had in France was visiting the Cathedral
a chart and if you've never been there
it's a beautiful 400 year old cathedral
beautiful stained glass and as I'll be
honest with you is a very very moving
experience and as I was writing my name
on it with a can of spray paint I I
[Applause]
thought of a religious experience I had
earlier about six months ago I was at
home and an angel appeared before me and
it's so much fun cuz you the best thing
to do if an angel appears before you you
try and poke your hand through them it
drives them not to go whoa but you know
it's so hard to believe in anything
anymore you know that like religion is
so mythological and it's awesome story
of myths came down from the sky with the
magic golden rings and science on the
other hand is just pure empiricism and
by virtue of its method it excludes
metaphysics and I guess I wouldn't
believe in anything if it weren't for my
lucky astrology mood watch
see this I got this for five bucks
[Applause]
well you've got to be a wise shopper
nowadays you see something like that you
better pick it up because well with
prices today I wanted to buy some
carpeting you know much they want for
carpeting $15 a square yard and I'm
sorry I am NOT going to pay that for
carpeting
so what I did I bought two square yards
and when I go home I strap them to my
feet
[Music]
by the way I handle all my own finances
I don't believe in that accountants
stuff and I'm happy to say I recently
purchased my own form of private
transportation which we landed out here
at the airport a couple of days ago
it's not easy landing a station wagon
out here at the airport and also we
never announced this ahead of time
because it always sounds like a phony
deal but part of the money taken in here
tonight will be going to charity I do a
lot of work with unwed mothers
no just helping them get their start now
come on
seriously I do work with the SPCA a lot
and now there's a lot of things going on
now
like in Mexico some people think it's a
sport I happen to think it's cruelty to
animals I'm talking about of course cat
juggling I take the little kitties Tim
four weeks old and they juggle them for
money the poor little kittens are going
yeah
[Applause]
and there's something going on in Kansas
right now it makes me sick they take
little laboratory mice never heard
anybody bring them out to Hollywood and
tell them they're going to be in
pictures
[Applause]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Applause]
I know what you're saying you're saying
oh I'll bet he's on drugs well I just
like to say right now don't take any
drugs I completely quit taking
everything and that includes getting
small
[Applause]
sure that's easy for you to do you
haven't been through what I haven't been
through you see about three weeks ago I
test twos thank God I had some close
friends there - can I get me up and walk
me around a little bit
[Music]
they lost smoking out there it kind of
bothers some people here trying to watch
the show on someone sitting in front of
you long the only time it bothers me if
I'm in a restaurant and I'm eating uh
someone says hey mind if I smoke
oh I see oh no do you mind if I
[Applause]
do you ever wonder where all the farts
go
[Applause]
well I'll tell you they go up into the
atmosphere and they form the fart zone
[Applause]
it's right above the ozone layer and
this is why we have to protect the ozone
layer
see if anything happens to the ozone bin
the farts fall back to earth and not on
their original owners
you know I used to make a lot of sex
jokes during my show and I've pretty
much cut it out and I'll tell you why I
think the reason I made the jokes is
because I was insecure and I've grown
more secure as a matter of fact I quit
using the amateur --fill acting's I only
use the prophylactics now but I feel
pretty good tonight I really do I think
I think tonight's gonna be the night for
me I think you know what I'm talking I'm
a rambling guy
no you come up here to Universal City no
let's be honest there's a lot of feeling
man is only a guy probably hanging out
in the parking lot after the show
looking for of your loans too
let's see what's the most decent way I
can put this um I confer girl wants to
do a little of this okay
[Applause]
[Music]
and who knows I might even get into some
of this I'm not too sure well boy
wouldn't it be wild if she was into
actually that's a myth about
entertainers I always think you meet
girls sing it don't because here I'm in
town for nine days and you don't have
time to get to know anybody and I'm not
into that one-night thing I think a
person should get to know someone and
even be in love with them before you use
and degrade them
and I feel sorry for women I'll tell you
why because so many men think they're
into this kinky sex and I wouldn't have
said that but six months ago I met a
girl and she was taking singing lessons
and her coach 84 year old guy you think
it'd be the last guy in the world to be
weird but listen to this he kept wanting
her to sing from her diaphragm
[Music]
[Applause]
I mean that would take years to learn
that
and this doesn't happen very often about
three weeks ago I met a girl she was
real nice and she invited me to her
apartment so I went over there and she
had the best pussy I have him oh come on
I'm talking about her cat now that makes
me sick right
you can't say anything anymore that
people don't take it dirty and I'm sorry
that disgusts me that cat was the best
vodka
[Applause]
how many people have cats one two three
okay ten now let me ask you this do you
trust them because I've got to get up
here a cat handcuffs and I gotta get
them right away just the little ones
that go around the little front paws or
maybe the manacles of four that get all
four paws but what a drag I found that
my cat was embezzling from me you think
you know a cat for ten years he pulled
something like this turned out while I
was away he would go out to the mailbox
pick up the checks take him down to the
bank in cash room disguised as me he had
the little kitty arrow through the hand
and I wouldn't cut him but I went
outside those little house where he
sleeps there was about $3,000 worth of
cat toys out there and you can't return
them because they have spit all over
them
so now I'm stuck with $3,000 for the cat
toys sure they're fun got the little
rubber Mouse has a bell inside of it
[Music]
[Applause]
