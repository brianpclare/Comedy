that was very nice thank you look now
you're a wonderful crowd but I need you
I need you to keep your energy up the
entire show okay because some crowds
some crowds they have big energy in the
beginning and then they run out of
places to go so I don't judge those
crowds by the way okay we've all gone
too big too fast and then run out of
room we've all made a happy birthday
sign
you get that poster board up and you're
like I don't need to trace it I know how
big letters should be but to begin with
a big a stage followed by a big a say Oh
No Oh God
okay alright real skinny P with a high
hump with a high hump and and we'll put
the second P below the hump of that
first P sort of like a motorcycle
sidecar situation and now I have no room
for the Y's well I'll do a kind of
curled up noodle Y lot letters and
cursive look good together and then you
go to write birthday and you totally
forget the lesson you just learned with
happy you like yeah but the past is the
past big ass be surely more letters will
fit in the same space you're very
friendly here in Chicago I mean we're
all violent here but you're very
friendly
I don't like confrontation because I've
never been in a fight before though
maybe you could tell that from the first
moment I walked out on stage I don't
give off that vibe some people give off
a vibe of like right away they like do
not fuck with me my vibe is more like
hey you could pour soup in my lap and
I'll probably apologize to you when I
walk for real my feet go out like this
I'm so open and vulnerable I look like a
doll that you point out molestation on
show us on this white comedian where the
man touched you oh it's been a while
since I've been home to Chicago I got
married since then
I married my wife I love saying my wife
it sounds so adult that's my wife it's
great you sound like a person I said it
even before we were married we were just
dating and we were once getting on an
airplane and anna's ticket didn't say
anything and my ticket said priority
access it doesn't matter why we're
getting on and i said can my wife board
with me and they were like yes of course
right this way and i was like oh that is
so much better than all those times I
was like can my girlfriend come and yeah
I shouldn't have said it that way but
still my wife just has some kick ass to
it you know get away from my wife no one
talked to my wife marriage is going to
be very magical I didn't kill my wife
that's I know who's that fella
I bet he did kill his wife
being married so nice I never knew
relationships were supposed to make you
feel better about yourself that's not
really a joke that's just a little sweet
thing I like to say cuz I've been in
relationships where I got cheated on
like long ones I don't know if you've
ever been in a long relationship where
you got cheated on but it changes your
whole worldview cuz like when I was a
kid I used to watch America's Most
Wanted you know how kids do
and I would always think to myself how
could another person kill someone how
could a human being kill another human
being and then I got cheated on and I
was like oh okay I'm not gonna do it but
I totally get it
we have like no one else can have you
like I don't care about that it's just
creepy to have an axe out there after
things have ended badly they have a lot
of information anyone who's seen my dick
and met my parents needs to die I can't
happen I talk to a lot of people before
I got engaged you know and I heard this
expression about whether or not you
should get married this is an old
expression people say this they say why
buy the cow when you can get the milk
for free you ever heard that before
it's a bananas insulting expression to
an entire gender but also it makes no
sense
why buy the cow when you can get the
milk for free you're not allowed to milk
a cow that you don't own
that's not even a situation was that a
problem at one point like in the dairy
community was that happening like a
hundred years ago in some village some
Dutch prick was sneaking in at night
being like I take you milk and the
farmer was like one of them this is your
cow now and he was like no no proof of
purchase and he ran off into the night
that's down to ducks right you know what
that you know what that expression means
it means why would you marry a woman if
she's already having sex with you which
has nothing to do with what
relationships are even like anymore now
it's like why buy the cow question mark
maybe because every day the Kyle asks
you when you're gonna buy it
[Music]
you live in a really small apartment
with the cows though you can't avoid
that question at all and also the cow is
way better at arguing than you are when
the cow grew up in a family that knows
how to argue why buy the cow question
mark
maybe because every time another cow
gets bought you have to go to the sale
and you have to sit next to your cow at
the sale and your cow looks over you the
entire time like
[Music]
and she's especially mad because that
farmer and cow met like eight months
after you guys met why buy the cow well
let's be real here you're very lucky to
have the cow that you do have their
opening cows and getting milk out of
them was never anything you were known
for John by the most liberal of
estimates there have been about eight
cows total several um milked and a lot
of people think that you like Bulls and
if you just thought they assumed it when
you search your name the third thing to
come up is like Joe Mullaney bull
question mark and if you just bought the
cow nobody would say that anymore
[Music]
they'll still say it cuz there are those
guys who they buy a cow and then on the
side total Matador but but for real
Chicago why buy the cow let's be real
why buy the cow because you love her you
really do and yeah yeah sure she's a
ballsy little cube she takes care of you
and you don't want to be some old man
stumbling around like hey you seen any
loose milk
[Music]
my wife is Jewish she's in New York - I
did
now I was raised Catholic I don't know
if you can tell that from the everything
about me
[Music]
my wife is Jewish I grew up Catholic so
we got married by a friend being married
by a friend is a beautiful ceremony that
alienates both families religions while
confusing the elderly people at the
wedding what's the name of the bishop
that's actually stand-up comedian Dan
levy he was the host of mtv's your place
or mine I saw a lot of Catholic weddings
though because that was an altar boy and
a hush falls over the room isn't it
weird how that became a scandalous thing
there was just some boring shit I had to
do on weekends but now it's like saying
I was a french maid for a period of time
I was treated well in my day I worked
for a variety of sirs now being an altar
boy was just a boring gig you know you'd
serve you'd serve Mass and then you
serve weddings sometimes my brother was
once an altar boy at a wedding and he
was standing there with another altar
boy this big packed Church in Chicago
where we grew up and the bride was
coming down the aisle and the organ was
playing and all the pews were filled and
the bride got all the way to the altar
and the groom lifted the veil off of the
bride and right at that moment the other
altar boy said oh she's ugly
and then they looked and they were right
next to the video camera and I know
that's awful but wouldn't you give like
a million dollars to see that wedding
video there's the best moment of his
stupid woman's life if she's walking
down the aisle in the organs like she
gets all the way to the altar to her
betrothed and he unveils her to the
world into the eyes of God and right at
that second for no reason at all
some cheeto fingered rat mustache 13
year old prick decides to go she's ugly
[Music]
hopefully the videographer knew some
sound editing so he could fix it to be
like oh she's beautiful she's enchanting
I grew up Catholic I don't go to church
anymore but I went on Christmas Eve with
my parents because you know how you lie
to your parents so we go into the church
and I was like I got this under control
and then I got schooled because they
introduced a bunch of new shit
no I was going through mass and I was
batting like 400 and then in the middle
of mass the priest said peace be with
you and everyone said and with your
spirit
and I was like the 1 3 y2k asshole going
and also with you when for those of you
that aren't Catholic I don't mean to
exclude you even though we love to
exclude you but there's a part in church
where the priest says peace be with you
and for many many years we all said very
good but they changed it to end with
your spirit because that's what needed
revamping in the Catholic Church
hey Ricky will they need
they were like let's see what a problems
can't we solve problem one no
[Music]
I'm actually glad they changed that
though I never liked and also with you I
always found that clunky and also with
you that's not how you talk have a nice
day and also you having one it's just a
little bit wrong isn't it it's just a
little off like when someone's like how
are you and you're like nothing much and
it's sort of make sense never begin a
sentence with and also you just
immediately sound caught off guard it
sounds like you've at the first church
ever like they weren't expecting it like
the priest was like hey this is the
first time we've ever had church I just
want to say peace be with you
and they were like Zuzu what oh uh yeah
and and and also you should have some
hey that's good let's keep that for two
thousand years and then change it to
trick John
my wife and I don't have any children we
have a dog we have a little puppy named
petunia she's a tiny little french
bulldog puppy I like having a puppy
that's a bulldog cause it's like having
a baby that is also a grandma her her
body is young her face is as old as time
she definitely saw the Nazis marched
into Paris she oh it gives me this look
of like all the things I have seen you
cocksucker
you have no idea they get stopple
through my printing press into a river
but go tell your fucking jokes
bring me my dish she said that petunia
petunia is my best friend in the world I
gave her a million kisses a day she does
not like me and barks at me invites me
all day long we had to get a dog trainer
into the apartment because petunia is a
bad dog we tell her that every day we go
you're bad at being a dark so the
trainer came into the apartment dis I
didn't even walk into the apartment
walked into the threshold and went oh
okay she was an exorcist or something
she said I see what the problem is she
said petunia has become the Alpha of the
house and she pointed at me she said you
are no longer the Alpha of the house and
in the back of my head I was like how is
never the ALF of the house I turned to
my wife I was like let's pretend it'll
be fun yes I owe my title of alpha which
I once had how could I reclaim it
because that was a thing that existed at
one time she said you need to show
dominance over your puppy these are
things people say to me
I said how do I do that she said well
let me ask you this
who eats dinner first you or petunia I
was like petunia eats dinner first
she's dinner at 5 p.m. cause she's a
foot long and 2 years old she said no
you need to eat dinner first because the
King eats before anyone else eats oh yes
and what a mighty king I will be eating
dinner at 4:45 in the afternoon look
upon your sovereign petunia and tremble
my lens stretch across this entire
one-bedroom and i dinner whatever I
choose as long as it works for the
schedule of a dog she said no you don't
actually have to eat dinner before
petunia you just have to convince
petunia that you've already eaten
[Music]
so for the past month I shit you not
before my wife and I give petunia her
dish we take down empty bowls and spoons
and in front of her we go dinner good
dinner like were space aliens in a play
about human beings that they wrote but
they didn't work that hard on we're
eating dinner meanwhile petunias just
staring at us with her paul giamatti
face like you're not eating dinner
cocksucker dish now I have a wife and a
dog and we just bought a house we have a
new house it's I was built in the 20s
but it was flipped in 2014 which means
it's haunted but it has a lovely kitchen
backsplash
I actually we didn't buy a house a bank
bought a house and I'm allowed to keep
my shirts and pants there while I pay it
off for 30 years the woman from the bank
came over and she showed me my mortgage
broken down month by month for 30 years
and she said so for instance this is
what you'll pay in July of 2029 and I
burst out laughing I was like 20 29
that's not a real year by 2029 I'll be
drinking moon juice with President
Jonathan Taylor Thomas I'm not going to
be writing you a paper check I like
having a house but I loved looking for a
house because I love real estate agents
I mean they are the true heroes they
really are have you ever watched HGTV
Miele state agents have to deal with the
dumbest people in the world making the
biggest decisions of their lives every
episode of HGTV is like Craig and
stockier looking for a two-story a-frame
that's near Craig's job in the downtown
but also satisfies a Sia's need to be
near the beach which is nowhere near
Craig's job with three children and nine
on the way and a max budget of $7
let's see what Lori Jo can do on this
week's episode of you don't deserve a
beach house I loved our real estate
agent
it was so fun to hang out with her it
was like hanging out with my mom cuz you
know real estate agents always look like
your mom and they have various Chico's
accoutrements and they always have kind
of fun mom energy there I was so excited
to see you too we would have little
conferences before we walked into a
house you go let's talk let's talk
before we go in we're like two feet from
the door so there's no toilets and I
know that was on your list
[Music]
but I think I can get him to budge let's
go
[Music]
so we'd have a real estate agent and
then like the house would have a real
estate agent who's just some guy sitting
in a big chair and these two always
hated each other would be like hi Tony
hi Kim like Jesus Christ what were you
doing the Eagles together what is the
animosity about our real estate agent
wanted us to have a baby more than
anyone else in our lives more than
anyone on our family she hinted about it
constantly
every room she walked into she'd be like
so this could be an office
[Music]
or maybe a nursery yeah I know like we
said we don't know if we're gonna happen
no no I know I know you're not you don't
know if you're gonna have what about you
know you know you never know sometimes
you don't know what's gonna happen and
then you know something happens well
yeah that's how all of life works
this is a non-fire garbage can
could be a nursery
[Music]
she showed me a backyard once she goes I
don't even like this backyard for you I
was like oh do tell she said it's all
pavement I think you should have some
grass out there you know in case you
have a couple little guys running around
in the grass and I got offended on
behalf of my imaginary kids I was like
hey lady I went outside about as much as
powder from the movie powder my children
are not going to be playing out on grass
they will be up in their rooms playing
violent video games and catfishing
pedophiles these are my children
[Music]
I didn't mean to make it sound like we
don't want children we don't but I
didn't mean to make it sound like that
see I just don't think babies like me
very much sometimes babies will point at
me and I don't care for that shit at all
like I'll be on an elevator and a baby
will be there in its big like stroller
activity tray just like working on one
cheerio with Bobby Fischer like
intensity
[Music]
and it'll look up at me and go I like to
lean in and go stop snitching
motherfuckin and walk on cuz you're
never too young to learn our nationís
mission policy my friends have babies
and I don't do so well with them I had a
run-in with a 2 year old girl I know
there are better ways to start that
story but my friend jeremy has this two
year old girl and I really like her
sweet kid I really like his daughter a
lot but I was over at his family's house
for the fourth of July and he had his
daughter on his knee and it was a very
lovely day his whole extended family was
there and he was bouncing his
two-year-old up and down and he pointed
at me and he said to his two-year-old do
you know who that is
that's your Uncle John and I was like oh
my god that's so sweet
I'm her uncle John and then the baby
pointed at me and said Uncle John has a
penis I thank you for laughing because
no one did that day
fell deadly silent is what they all did
[Music]
hey do you know what you're supposed to
say when a baby points at you and
knowingly says he has a penis no I'm
asking because I don't know what to say
in that situation here's what I went
with that day I said oh come on I don't
know I thought that'd be good but then
it just made it worse because it sounded
like the baby and I had an arrangement
not to talk about it
and she had violated my trust like the
baby had been like do you have a penis
and I was like yes I do but you're a
baby's the discretion is key and then
the next day she goes he has a penis and
I go oh come on someone can't keep a
secret
luckily Jeremy's wife saved the day the
baby's mom saved the day she came in and
she picked up the baby and she was like
it's okay she's just going through that
phase where she says penis and vagina a
lot aren't we all
and by the way it would have been a
totally different situation if the baby
had said vagina
like if a grown woman had walked in the
room and the baby had been like she has
a vagina the woman could be like yes I
do and its magnificence and we would all
be like her
no one wants to applaud the penis of a
32 year old weirdo it's fun to be
married I've never been supervised
before
I'm supervised she studies what I do
like an anthropologist should be like
sometimes he will watch a movie on TV
even though he already owns that movie
on DVD pointing this out to him confuses
and upsets him
I have no supervision when I was a kid
we were free to do what we wanted but
also with that no one cared about kids I
grew up before children were special I
did very early 80s right before children
became special like I remember when milk
carton kids became a thing when they
were like hey we should start looking
for some of these guys I don't think
they're just blowing off steam
no one cared about my opinion when I was
a little kid no one cared what I thought
sometimes people would say what do you
think you're doing but that just meant
stop they didn't actually want to know
my thought process they don't want me to
be like well I was gonna put this bottle
rocket into this Cardon of eggs so that
when I lit off the bottle rocket the
eggs would have blood everywhere oh
that's very interesting and what brought
you to this experiment oh well thank you
for asking well you know how I'm filled
with rage I'm so horny and angry all the
time and I have no outlet for it so eggs
your opinion doesn't matter in
elementary school either it matters in
college college is just your opinion
just you raising your hand and being
like I think Emily Dickinson's a lesbian
and they're like partial credit and
that's like a whole thing but in
elementary school that doesn't matter
what you think it just matters what you
know you have to have answers to
questions and if you say I don't know
you get an X on your test and you get it
wrong and that's not fair because your
brain has never been smaller also that's
not how life works like I'm in my 30s
now if you came to me now and you were
like hey John name three things that the
Stamp Act of 1773 n't but when you're a
little kid you can't say I don't know
you should be able to there should be an
acceptable answer on a test you should
be able to write in I don't know I know
you told me but I have had a very long
day I am very small
and I have no money so you can imagine
the kind of stress that I am under or if
it's one of the true or false questions
you should be able to add a third option
which is who's to say
[Music]
kids are much more supervised now but
also they have a lot of rights like
that's the biggest civil rights increase
I've seen in my lifetime
the rights of children have gone through
the roof I had no rights when I was a
little kid I remember one time I walked
into a supermarket by myself I walked in
through the double doors and the woman
behind the register just looked at me
and she went no turned around and left
that's how broken I was and there
weren't special things for kids the way
they are now like we would just go see
movies any movie like Back to the Future
that was a movie like everyone could see
kids to kind of say it great movie right
I rewatched it recently it's a very
weird movie
Marty McFly is a 17 year old high school
student whose best friend is a disgraced
nuclear physicist and I should you not
they never explained how they became
friends they never explained it there's
not not even in a lazy way like hey
member when we met in the Science
Building like they don't even do that
and we were all fine with it we were
just like what who's his best friend a
disgraced nuclear physicist
all right proceed
what a strange movie to sell to his
family movie two guys had to go in and
do that they had to be like okay we got
an idea for the next big family action
comedy alright it's about a guy named
Marty and he's very lazy he's always
sleeping late okay is he is he cool like
Ferris Bueller now but he does have this
best friend who's you know a disgraced
nuclear physicist
I'm confused here this best friend this
is another student or oh no no no no no
this guy's either like 40 or 80 Larry
even we don't know how this guys
supposed to be but one day the boy and
the scientist they go back in time and
they build a time machine whoa
[Music]
okay I think I see where you're going
here they build a time machine and they
go back in time and they stop the
Kennedy assassination ah that's a really
good idea where did it think of that all
right well what do they do with the time
machine
well now I'm embarrassed to say all
right we thought yeah we thought it
would be funny you know if the boy if he
went back in time and you know he tried
to fuck his mom
[Music]
we thought that'd be fun for people but
you're a good point no he doesn't get to
he doesn't get to because this family
friend named Biff he comes in and tries
to rape the mom in front of the son that
dad's got a beat the rapist off of her
and also we're going to imply that a
white man wrote Johnny be good so we're
going to take that away from him well
this is the best movie idea I have ever
heard in my life
we're going to make three of them now
you say they go to the Past how about we
call it back to the past nut up a Back
to the Future right but they go to the
past yeah
[Music]
it sounded very good now my friends a
teacher she told me that the parents
will take the kids side over the teacher
now that's insane
that never happened my parents trusted
every grown-up more than they trusted me
I don't mean like I don't mean coaches
and teachers any human adult's word was
better than mine any hobo or drifter
could have taken me by the ear up to my
front door and been like scares me ya
can't bit my dick and my mom would be
like Sean Edmund Mulaney did you bite
this nice man's dick and I would be the
only one who's like it has it anyone
wanna know why his dick was near my
biters in the first place isn't anyone
curious as to how I had access
[Music]
don't get me wrong my parents love us
they just didn't like us we weren't
friends people are now like my mom's my
best friend as I go is she a super bad
mom
my parents didn't trust us and they
shouldn't have trusted us we were little
goblins we were terrible I remember one
time we were going to this resort for a
vacation when were little kids three
weeks before we went to the resort my
dad sat us down he said all right we're
going to a resort and I've just been
informed that the man who owns the
resort only has one arm and we were like
oh
[Music]
now I'm telling you three weeks in
advance so that you will not freak out
when you see that he only has one arm
our gonna freak out so bad yes John you
have a question how did he lose his arm
that's exactly what you won't ask and
then I did ask I went into the kitchen
one day and I was like so how'd you lose
your arm and he was like well I was born
with only one arm how's that
[Music]
no my parents loved us it's just like
they were the cops you know and we were
criminals so we didn't get along
we only got along in that way that like
cops will sometimes be chummy with
criminals like when my dad and I would
talk it was like that scene in the movie
heat when Robert De Niro and Al Pacino
sit down in that diner we kind of had
that rapport of like we're not so
different you and I you have your law
practice and me I have all these fucking
markers I guess we both have
responsibilities when you look at it
that way my dad would respect it if I
could get away with breaking a rule like
we had a rule in our house we were not
allowed to watch TV on a school night so
every school night I would 100% be
watching TV and I would hear my dad
coming I would immediately turn the TV
off and grab any book magazine
periodical anything and I'd open it and
pretend to be doing homework
my dad would walk in the room and he
would go what are you doing are you
watching TV and I got nah man I'm not
watching TV the TV wouldn't even be dark
yet it would still have like a neon
green halo around it and a V sizzling
like a glass of Pepsi and I would look
dead in the eyes and go now I'm just
reading this yellow pages my dad loved
us he just didn't care about our general
happiness or self-esteem I remember one
time we were really little kids I have
two sisters in her brother and all four
of us were in our family car ride for
three hours go into Wisconsin my dad was
driving going down the highway in our
white van with wood around the side okay
cuz you remember when you wanted your
car to be made of wood
remember that era where we were like how
much wood can we get on this car without
it catching on fire but then the big
announcement we here at Plymouth
Chrysler can put a saucy stripe of wood
is safely on the outside of your car for
all those times you've looked at your
minivan and thought huh it needs a belt
[Music]
so we're going on the highway we've been
on the road for like three hours and in
the distance we see a McDonald's we see
the golden arches and we got so excited
we started chanting McDonald's
McDonald's McDonald's McDonald's and my
dad pulled into the drive-thru and we
started cheering and then he ordered one
black coffee
for himself
and kept driving
[Music]
and you know as mad as that made me as a
little kid in retrospect that is the
funniest thing I have ever seen in my
entire life how perfect is that yeah
little kid and he got black coffee the
one thing from McDonald's no child could
enjoy my dad is cold-blooded
duh he was just a kid during Lion King
on Broadway that actually happened we
were in Lion King on Broadway and there
was a five-year-old behind us going look
Pumbaa
look it's Timon and my dad turned around
and said are you going to talk the
entire time he's my hero
the weirdest thing when I was like a kid
was how much they scared us about
smoking weed they scared us about it
constantly and I've been on tour this
year marijuana is legal in like 18 or 19
states in some form or another
it's insane yeah well alright don't move
with your white it's always been legal
for us
come on marijuana Billy Billy when I was
arrested with a one-hitter at a Rusted
Root concert I did not serve hard time I
think I got an award eighteen or
nineteen states and by the way I agree
it's a very good thing but it's also a
really weird thing because this is the
first time I've ever seen a lot change
because the government is just like fine
yeah I've never seen it before like gay
marriage in health care we have to
battle it out in the Supreme Court and
be like gay people are humans and
they're like we'll think about it but
with weed it was just something we
wanted really badly and we kept asking
them for 40 years like scares me and
then suddenly the government became like
cool parents and they're just like okay
here take a little weed rather you do it
in the house and go somewhere else' bla
bla bla
[Music]
[Music]
and that's a big deal because they
scared us about weed constantly it would
be on our sitcoms we'd be watching Saved
by the Bell we'd be having a great old
time and then suddenly a character we
had not seen before would show up with
some weed and the episode would stop
cold in its tracks and they'd always
hold the joint the bad guy would hold
the joint in like a villainous way we'd
always offer the joint in a way that no
one ever holds a joint like it's a skull
and a Shakespeare play and now it's
legal and that is great news unless
you're a weed dealer and then it is
terrible news and I don't just mean
because they're about to lose out to
amazon.com I'm or feel bad for weed
dealers because they're about to find
out that we only showed them a certain
amount of politeness because they had an
illegal product and we don't show that
same politeness to people who deliver
legal products like when the Chinese
food delivery guy comes we don't let him
hang out after he's delivered the
Chinese food
[Music]
and we don't look the other way when he
says weird shit - the girls were hanging
out with to try to preserve the
relationship and we definitely don't
give him some of the Chinese food he's
never like hey can I get in on those
dumplings and we're like yeah we're all
friends what are you on your phone hey
v-neck hey
[Music]
what's your name Sam cool
[Music]
what do you do to afford v-necks am
typing numbers ah numbers the letters of
math I'm sorry to bother you I don't
mean to single you out I hate when
people get pulled out of the audience
like you familiar with this Cirque du
Soleil Sam they're a group of French
assholes that are slowly taking over
America by humiliating audience members
one by one we once went to see Cirque du
Soleil at Navy Pier when I was a kid and
my brother came and he was like 12 years
old and you remember being 12 and you're
like no one look at me or I'll kill
myself and these French bastards come
into the crowd be like all love on a
deer VB Park wag wag wag and they pulled
my brother up on stage and I was like no
and they brought him up and they reached
into his sweatshirt there when I roll on
the boy and they had planted a bra and
they pulled out a bra and they were like
oh my no
when everyone Navy Pier was like ah ha
and my brothers like hey that's great
I have had other jobs besides comedy I
was an office temp for a while
I really missed that I loved being a
temp cuz I would just go from office to
office and be terrible at a different
job for a week and then you just get to
retire like Lou Gehrig you're like thank
you no one will ever see me again and
they're like goodbye I worked in an
office once on 57th Street in New York
City was there for a couple weeks I was
in a cubicle next to this other cubicle
this woman named maecius at any other
cubicle I want to get the number right I
think Nisha had about 900,000 photos of
her daughter up in her cubicle almost
like she was trying to solve a
conspiracy about her daughter a
beautiful mind style I think about Nisha
two times a week
because of a phone call she had next to
me one day it was one of my first days
and I was sitting next to her and her
phone rang and this was her call and I'm
quoting her phone rang and she said
hello and then she hung up
[Music]
think about that two times a week and I
didn't know where well enough by then to
be like hey what kind of a person are
you you know who could she have been
talking to hello this was a place of
business
my only table raseteurs like the CEO of
the company being like Misha help I'm
doing a crossword puzzle
I need a four-letter word for be quiet
right now you're promoted I attempted a
little web company on 25th Street in New
York City it was a small web company
owned by this old man whose old old old
money New York his name was Henry J
Finch the fourth like old old old money
like his money was in molasses or
something he owned this web company I
have no idea why he owned this web
company I think he wanted in a rich
man's game of like dice and small
binoculars or something mr. Finch wore
linen suits he had suspenders he had a
bow tie he had a hat he had a cane with
an ivory handle I'm giving you more
description than you need because I need
you to believe me this was a real person
I knew in the 21st century mr. Finch was
in his 70s he had an assistant named
Mary she was in her 50s she was Korean I
don't know why he had an assistant he
did not need one unless he needed
someone to be like remember mr. Finch at
five o'clock you need to keep looking
like a hard-boiled egg
one day mr. Finch came into the office
it had been raining everything I'm about
to say to you was said in front of me on
that afternoon mr. Finch walked into the
office and he was wearing a raincoat he
was wearing a rain hat and he had his
cane and he walked in and he said and
I'm quoting ah one feels like a duck
splashing around and all this wet and
when one feels like a duck what is happy
and then Mary yelled Oh ducklings to
which mr. Finch replied too old to be a
duckling quack quack and then walked
into his office
[Music]
I think about that every goddamn day
I mean imagine you're me you're a 22
year old temp and you're so hungover and
you just want to die every day and then
that happens in front of you and I don't
know gives you hope and I did that a
little fast let me break that
conversation down for you mr. Finch
walked in and he began a conversation
the way anyone would
[Music]
one feels like a duck splashing around
in all this wet the rain and when one
feels like a duck one is happy now
that's debatable
rather than debate that point Mary
brought up a new separate but
interesting point which was duckies
but mr. Finch ever the realist about his
own age in mortality said I too old to
be a duckling as if to say my duckling
days are behind me Mary don't you see
I'm a duck now and to prove it
well I'll say just about the most famous
catchphrase a duck ass quack quack
[Music]
right that moment by the way that it
meant nothing to mr. Finch but he it
said crazy people are like that they
have unlimited crazy currency like if I
gone into his office a couple weeks
later in bed line - she remember that
time you were like too old to be a
duckling quack quack you just be like ah
perhaps I did quack but such is life for
an old Knickerbocker like me like he'd
say something else
crazy that's the wonderful thing about
crazy people you know is that they just
have unlimited currency the things they
say mean nothing to them but they mean
everything to me
I was once walking into Penn Station in
New York I was walking down 31st Street
towards 8th Avenue I'm walking down 31st
there's this woman standing at 8th and
31st I have my little roller suitcase
you can all imagine I'm walking towards
her she's smoking a cigarette that is
not lit anymore she's watching me walk
kind of scanning me up and down as if
she had terminator vision where she
could see little bits of data like
little honky-ass
and could read information as I walk
past her she said this to me I walk past
her and she said and I'm quoting eat ass
suck a dick and sell drugs
[Music]
very dirty yes a very upsetting thing to
hear yes I'm sorry you all had to hear
that but at least you all got to hear it
as a group
I was alone out there that afternoon and
she said this totally unprompted eat ass
suck a dick and sell drugs wasn't like I
had paused in front of her and been like
what should I do with my life
[Music]
so I walk away from her with this to-do
list
and I like structure I like it to-do
list it did dawn on me that list of
things does get better as it goes along
when you really think about it because
it starts in a pretty rough place it
starts with just about the worst task a
to-do list can start with but by the end
you have your own small business and
isn't that the American dream when all's
said and done enough one day you can
sell drugs imagine you did all that to
sell drugs and then they legalize drugs
and you were like what
[Music]
he's been a real thrill to perform here
by the way I just want to say that in
all sincerity
thanks for coming about really really
appreciate it I want to tell you one
more story before I get out of here
about the night I met a guy named Bill
Clinton now I don't some of you know who
that is for those of you that don't he
was President of the United States from
1993 until 2001 and he is a smooth and
fantastic hillbilly who should be
declared Emperor of the United States of
America now I know you know who Bill
Clinton is but I was doing a show at a
college and I mentioned Bill Clinton and
like they kind of didn't know who he was
like sorry
they knew the name right but they only
knew this 2015 Bill Clinton who's a very
different Bill Clinton have you seen his
ass lately what the hell is he trying to
pull he's all thin now and he wears
these little tight suits and he's got
these grandpa reading glasses like hey I
can't do nothing on nobody no more Oh me
I'm just old oh man I don't have the
appetites you know he's always flying
around the world with Bill Gates trying
to cure AIDS that is not the Bill
Clinton that we all signed up for 20
years
to go our Bill Clinton was like a big
fat buddy Garrity from Friday Night
Lights looking guy who played the
saxophone on Arsenio and his work in the
STD community was not in curing anything
at that time that was the man we all
elected presidents that was the Bill
Clinton that I met I got to meet Bill
Clinton when he was governor Clinton in
1992 when he was first running for
president and I got to meet Bill Clinton
because my parents had gone to the same
colleges Bill Clinton they're a little
younger but they went to the same
college so when he was first running for
president he would have all these big
like alumni fundraisers and everyone who
went was invited to go now this was
really cool for a couple reasons one I
got to meet Bill Clinton but you I got
to watch my parents watch someone they
went to school with become the president
and that is super funny to see because
think about some of the people you went
to school with now imagine they're
becoming the president imagine Sam was
becoming the president
strong emotions and my parents had very
different opinions on Bill Clinton my
mom loved Bill Clinton because Bill
Clinton was always a really charismatic
handsome guy I mean think about how many
women he got in the 1990s when he looked
like Frank Caliendo doing John Madden
now imagine him as a college student
when my mom tells me that there was a
sort of chivalrous policy on campus back
then where late at night if female
students were leaving the library
unaccompanied male students were
encouraged to wait out in front and
offer to walk them home that sounds good
right so my mom tells me that Bill
Clinton would be out in front of the
library every single night just being
like hey can I walk you home hey can I
walk you home hey can I walk you home
hey can I walk you home and one night my
mom was leaving the library and Bill
Clinton was like hey can I walk you home
and my mom was like hell yes so this is
absolutely true my mom little Allen
Stanton walked arm-in-arm with Bill
Clinton to her dorm and she was like you
know I wanted to invite him up for a
beer and I was like thanks I'm nine five
her roommate was upstairs so she lost
her chance with Bill Clinton now my dad
on the other hand hated Bill Clinton
because my parents were dating during
this time and also my dad's a much more
like morally upright conservative kind
of guy he always told me that he hated
it in college that Bill Clinton could
quote get away with anything can you
imagine how he felt later so one day
this invitation arrives for a fundraiser
where you can meet Bill Clinton my mom
opens at first she goes oh we have to go
we have to go see Bill and without
looking up at her my dad just says why
it's not like he's gonna remember you
one black coffee and motherfucker
so my mom says fine I'll go and I'll
take John and I was like hell yeah and I
split in the room in my first communion
suit ready to go because I loved Bill
Clinton I was 10 years old if you were a
kid when Bill Clinton was first released
it was the most exciting thing ever
we'd never seen a cool politician before
and he would go on MTV and he'd have
cool answers to kids questions they'd be
like governor what's your favorite food
and he'd be like I don't know fries we'd
be like yeah I learned to play his
campaign song on the piano it was don't
stopped by Fleetwood Mac from rumors and
album written by and for people cheating
on each other he let us know who he was
right away so I went with my mom as her
date to reconnect with Governor Bill
Clinton we walked into the ballroom is a
big hotel ballroom it was the Palmer
House Hilton big Hilton hotel bar ooh
watching the ballroom was packed with
people it's actually it's the ballroom
from the end of the movie The Fugitive
right so that bar so my mom and I walk
in it's packed with people the desire
the end where Harrison Ford as dr.
Richard Kimble
Merson they confront dr. Charles Nichols
right okay so that ballroom so my mom
and I walk in it's packed with people
why does Kimball confront Nichols well I
know we all know this quite better but
black papa
Kimball he found out that Nichols along
with Devlin MacGregor and lens whose
mysteriously died late hired Fredrick
Sykes to one our man to kill Kimball
Kimball's wife wasn't even the target I
know we all know this but they were
gonna kill Kimball because he wasn't
going to approve certain liver samples
to pass are you d90 so Kimball finds out
about all of this and of course he's
furious and he bursts in the ballroom
and he goes just switch the samples and
dr. Nichols is like ladies and gentlemen
my friend dr. Richard Kimble what accent
did that guy have by the way because you
put the samples and you doctored your
research so that you can have Pro Basak
anyway so is that ballroom so we walk
into that bar
[Music]
and packed with people a real who's not
of Chicago celebrities Walter Jacobson
was there
Walter Jacobson was the local Fox anchor
he do fun things we go undercover as a
homeless person and to be like Oh what
time is the soup and they'd be like man
you Walter Jacobson he was there
[Music]
everybody and on the far side of the
ballroom under spotlight we saw a little
bit of silver hair and it was him
Bill Clinton the comeback kid but he was
surrounded by reporters and
photographers and Secret Service so what
are you going to do well if you're my
mom you ball up the back of my sport
coat and you push me forward like a
human shield and then you start jogging
while yelling this ten-year-old boy has
to meet the next president of the United
States kind of implying that I might be
dying my feet were not on the
she was swinging me like a snowplow
I was just mowing down fat Chicago
Democrats I pushed past all the
reporters I pushed past all the
photographers we push past all the
Secret Service we land at Bill Clinton's
feet Bill Clinton turns looks at my mom
and says hey Ellen cuz he never forgets
a bitch ever
[Music]
my mom Nell she goes hi bill then it is
revealed that she has no plan so she
pushes me towards Clinton and she goes
this is my son John and he's also going
to be president and I was like what the
hell are you talking about I'm not gonna
be President and I know now that I'm
definitely never going to be President
not unless everyone gets real cool about
a bunch of stuff really quickly based on
my ten-year old memory Bill Clinton is
about 13 feet tall and he leaned down
because while I was wearing this button
that I bought outside the fundraiser is
a cartoon button of George HW Bush and
it had a quail flying over his head and
it was shitting on his head and it said
bird brained and I thought it was very
funny and Bill Clinton leaned down so
that only I could hear and he said hey
man I like your button
and I said you can do whatever you want
forever and he took my advice
[Music]
I got home that night and my dad was
still awake like reading angry under one
lamp just like and I went up to him and
I went hey I'm gonna be a Democrat and
I'm gonna vote for Bill Clinton and
without looking up at me my dad just
said you have the moral backbone of a
chocolate eclair
[Music]
you know how you talk to a child
so here's the end of that story that was
1992 let's flash forward five years to
1997 it is down 1997 I am a sophomore in
high school
Bill Clinton is in his
