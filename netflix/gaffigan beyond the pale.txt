 UGH... HMMM... 
" NARRATOR:  LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,  "
  MR. JIM GAFFIGAN.  
 -WHOO! 
 WHOO-OO! 
 EEE! 
 EEEE! 
 EEE! 
 EEE! 
 EEEEE! 
 EEE! 
" ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT STOP IT. "
 YOU LOOK LIKE YOU'RE ON DRUGS. 
" OH, HERE'S A PILL FELLA. "
   
 (AS AUDIENCE MEMBER) I DIDN'T 
 KNOW HE WAS GOING TO BE SO PALE. 
   
" (AS AUDIENCE MEMBER) OH, THAT "
 SHIRT LOOKS LIKE A TABLECLOTH. 
   
 (AS AUDIENCE MEMBER) IS THAT 
 A SHIRT OR A BLOUSE? 
   
 (AS AUDIENCE MEMBER) I 
 THINK HE'S WEARING  
 HIS MOTHER'S BLOUSE. 
   
 (AS AUDIENCE MEMBER) HIS 
 PANTS LOOK DIRTY. 
   
 (AS AUDIENCE MEMBER) I WONDER 
 IF HE'S WEARING A THONG. 
   
 (AS AUDIENCE MEMBER) I DIDN'T 
 WONDER THAT AND NOW I DO. 
   
 (AS AUDIENCE MEMBER) IS 
 THIS ALL HE DOES? 
   
 (AS AUDIENCE MEMBER) 
 THIS IS WEIRD. 
 I CAN BARELY HEAR WHAT 
 HE'S SAYING. 
   
   
   
 IT IS GREAT TO BE 
 HERE IN CHICAGO. 
 THANK YOU FOR COMING 
" OUT, APPRECIATE IT. "
   
 IT'S GOOD TO BE HERE. 
 I GUESS I SHOULD OPEN UP. 
 I'LL TELL A LITTLE 
 BIT ABOUT MYSELF. 
 I AM KOREAN. 
   
 I COME FROM THE COUNTRY 
 OF KOREA. 
   
" I'VE BEEN HERE FOR, HOW "
" DO YOU SAY, ONE DAY. "
   
" ACTUALLY I WISH I WAS KOREAN, "
 CAUSE THEN MY INTEREST IN 
 ASIAN WOMEN WOULDN'T BE 
 CONSIDERED SO CREEPY. 
   
 (AS AUDIENCE MEMBER) HE LOOKS 
 LIKE ONE OF THOSE GUYS. 
   
 (AS AUDIENCE MEMBER) HE 
 LOOKS LIKE A MORMON. 
   
 (AS AUDIENCE MEMBER) 
 WHAT'S WRONG WITH 
 LOOKING LIKE A MORMON? 
" ACTUALLY, I ONLY DATED "
 ONE ASIAN GIRL. 
 BUT SHE WAS VERY ASIAN. 
 SHE WAS A PANDA. 
   
 (AS AUDIENCE MEMBER) 
" HEY, I LIKE PANDAS. "
   
 (AS AUDIENCE MEMBER) THEY'RE 
 ENDANGERED FELLA. 
 YOU AND YOUR GIRL SHIRT. 
   
 NOT KOREAN. 
 I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN 
 TELL BY LOOKING AT ME. 
 BUT BOTH MY PARENTS 
 WERE WHITE. 
 (AS AUDIENCE MEMBER) I THINK ONE 
 OF THEM WAS A POLAR BEAR. 
   
 (AS AUDIENCE MEMBER) THAT'S WHY 
 HE WENT OUT WITH A PANDA. 
   
 (AS AUDIENCE MEMBER) I DIDN'T 
 KNOW HE WAS GOING TO BE DOING 
 BEAR JOKES. 
   
 (AS AUDIENCE MEMBER) HE'S 
 DOING A BIG SPECIAL. 
 HE'S DOING JOKES ABOUT BEARS. 
   
 (AS AUDIENCE MEMBER) 
 SEEMS WEIRD TO ME. 
 HE LOOKS LIKE HE EATS 
 A LOT OF CANDY. 
   
 I DO LOVE FOOD. 
 I EVEN ENJOY WATCHING 
 PEOPLE MAKE FOOD. 
 BUT YOU EVER NOTICE THE FOOD 
 NETWORK IS FAR MORE 
 INTERESTING WHEN YOUR HUNGRY? 
 WHEN YOU'RE FULL YOU'RE 
" LIKE, THIS IS STUPID. "
   
 BUT WHEN YOU'RE HUNGRY THE 
 FOOD NETWORK'S LIKE PORN. 
" YOU'RE LIKE, OH YEAH. "
   
 WHIP IT UP BABY. 
   
 MAKE IT FOR ME. 
 IT IS A LITTLE EMBARRASSING 
 WHEN SOMEONE CATCHES YOU 
 WATCHING THE FOOD NETWORK. 
 WHAT ARE YOU WATCHING? 
 UH-UH THE FOOD NETWORK. 
 WELL WHY ARE YOUR PANTS OFF? 
   
 I LIKE FOOD. 
 A LOT. 
 I DO LOVE FOOD. 
 I LIKE TO EAT LATE 
" AT NIGHT, TOO. "
 YOU KNOW YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED 
 TO EAT LATE AT NIGHT. 
 THEN AGAIN YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED 
 TO DRINK BOOZE IN THE MORNING. 
   
 AND APPARENTLY YOU'RE NEVER 
 SUPPOSED TO SMOKED CRACK. 
   
 WHATEVER. 
 I'M NOT TRAINING FOR 
 THE OLYMPICS. 
   
" SORRY, AFTER AN ENTIRE HOUR OF "
 WORK I WANT TO UNWIND WITH A 
 BURGER AND A CRACK PIPE. 
   
 IF I DO THAT EVERY NIGHT DOES 
 THAT MAKE ME SOME CRACKHEAD? 
 (AS AUDIENCE MEMBER) THIS 
 GUY'S A CRACKHEAD. 
   
 (AS AUDIENCE MEMBER) THAT'S 
 WHY HE'S SO PALE. 
 HE'S THE FATTEST CRACKHEAD 
 I'VE EVER SEEN. 
   
 I HAVE GAINED SOME WEIGHT. 
 BUT MOST OF THIS IS 
 A STOMACH IMPLANT. 
   
"   YOU ALL REGRET IT, "
 LIKE WHEN I'M TALKING TO A 
 WOMAN AND I'LL CATCH HER 
 STARING AT MY BELLY. 
" I'LL BE LIKE, HELLO, "
 I'M UP HERE. 
   
 NOT SOME PIECE OF FLAB 
 FOR YOU OOGLE AT. 
 I DON'T CARE IF I'M IN A TUBE 
 TOP AND I'M RUBBING COCOA 
" BUTTER, WHILE I'M RIDING "
" A UNICYCLE, "
" GOING LA, LA, LA, LA! "
   
 (AS AUDIENCE MEMBER) THAT WAS 
 THE WORST IMPRESSION OF A 
 UNICYCLE I'VE EVER SEEN. 
   
 (AS AUDIENCE MEMBER) IT'S 
 LIKE HE DIDN'T EVEN TRY. 
   
 I'M STARTING TO REALIZE 
 I'M A PIG. 
 YOU KNOW YOU'RE A PIG WHEN YOU 
 EAT SOMETHING THAT TASTES 
 HORRIBLE BUT YOU DON'T NOTICE 
 TIL THE LAST BITE. 
   
 WELL THIS WASN'T EVEN GOOD. 
   
" I GOTTA EAT SOMETHING ELSE, "
 GET RID OF THAT FLAVOR. 
   
 YOU EVER EAT SO MUCH 
 A FEEL SICK? 
 ISN'T THAT THE BEST? 
   
 THEN YOU FEEL LIKE 
 A REAL AMERICAN. 
" (AS AUDIENCE MEMBER) OH, THAT "
 WAS STRANGELY PATRIOTIC. 
   
 (AS AUDIENCE MEMBER) WEIRD. 
 (AS HIMSELF) I'M A PIG. 
 EVER GET HUNGRY WATCHING 
 A COMMERCIAL? 
 AND THEN YOU REALIZE IT'S A 
 COMMERCIAL FOR DOG FOOD? 
   
" HM, THOSE ARE SAVORY "
 CHUNKS OF BEEF. 
   
" RICH, CREAMY-- "
 WAIT WHY ARE THEY GIVING 
 IT TO THE DOG? 
   
 OH NO. 
 THANK GOD FOR PACKAGING. 
   
 I LOVE PACKAGING. 
 PACKAGING'S LIKE THE CLOTHING 
" OF FOOD, ISN'T IT? "
" OH, WHAT ARE WEARING "
 THERE COOKIE? 
   
 A LOVELY MINT MILANO PACK. 
   
" CANDY, LET ME HELP YOU "
 WITH THAT WRAPPER. 
   
 GET YOU A LITTLE BIT 
 MORE COMFORTABLE. 
" AND THE FANCIER THE FOOD, THE "
 MORE ELABORATE THE PACKAGING. 
 YOU EVER SEE GENERIC CEREAL? 
 IT COMES IN A PLASTIC BAG. 
 LIKE IT'S HOMELESS. 
   
 OH WE SHOULD FIND YOU 
 A BOX TO LIVE IN. 
   
 LIVING IN A BAG ON 
 THE BOTTOM SHELF. 
 THAT AIN'T RIGHT. 
 I BUY THE GENERICS. 
 I ALWAYS FEEL LIKE I HAVE TO 
" EXPLAIN TO THE CASHIER, I'M "
" LIKE, YEAH THESE GENERICS "
 THEY'RE FOR LIKE A CHEAP 
 NEIGHBOR OF MINE. 
   
 I GET ALL MY GROCERIES 
 FROM SHARPER IMAGE. 
   
 SKYMALL. 
 (AS AUDIENCE MEMBER) NO ONE BUYS 
 ANYTHING FROM SKYMALL. 
" HEY BUDDY, I WORK "
 FOR SKY MALL. 
 AND I DON'T APPRECIATE 
 YOU JABBING US. 
 (AS HIMSELF) I LOVE GOING 
 TO THE GROCERY STORE. 
 THOSE FREE SAMPLES. 
 IT'S ALWAYS A LITTLE 
 AWKWARD AFTER YOU 
 HAVE THE FREE SAMPLE. 
" YOU'RE LIKE, OOH SAUSAGE! "
" YEAH, ALL RIGHT. "
" WELL, SEE YA. "
   
 SUCKER. 
   
 CAUSE YOU KIND OF ACT 
 LIKE YOU'RE GOING TO 
 GET A CASE OF IT. 
 WELL THIS WOULD BE GOOD FOR 
 A PARTY NOW WOULDN'T IT? 
   
 NAH. 
 GOTCHA. 
   
 WHEN DID WE HAVE TO BECOME 
 MEMBERS OF ALL 
 THESE GROCERY STORES? 
 ARE YOU A MEMBER OF 
 OUR SECRET CLUB? 
 I'M JUST GETTING DORITOS. 
   
" WELL THAT'LL BE $4,000. "
   
 OR YOU CAN JOIN OUR CLUB. 
 I CAN'T COME TO A 
 LOT OF MEETINGS. 
   
 BUT I GUESS I'LL JOIN. 
 I DO FEEL GUILTY AT 
 CHECK OUT WHEN 
 THEY'RE BAGGING MY GROCERIES. 
 TALK ABOUT FEELING LAZY. 
 HEY THANKS FOR PUTTING MY 
 GROCERIES IN MY BAG. 
" YEAH, I COULD HELP BUT "
 I'LL JUST WATCH. 
   
 I'M EXHAUSTED FROM PICKING 
 THAT CRAP OUT. 
   
 YOU WANT TO COME HOME AND 
 WATCH ME EAT THEM? 
   
 I'M LOOKING FOR A BUDDY. 
   
 (AS AUDIENCE MEMBER) THIS GUY 
 TALKS A LOT ABOUT FOOD. 
   
 BUT REALLY WE'RE A COUNTRY 
 THAT LOVES FOOD. 
" I MEAN, THINK ABOUT IT. "
 ONCE A WEEK ON THE 
 NEWS THERE'S A 
 PIECE ON AMERICAN OBESITY. 
 THEY ALWAYS SHOW A 
 BIG GUY WALKING. 
 THEY'LL BLOCK OUT HIS FACE. 
 BUT THAT GUY KNOWS IT'S HIM. 
   
 WELL THAT SHIRT LOOKS 
 FAMILIAR. 
   
" OH, CRAP. "
   
 CAN'T WEAR THAT SHIRT AGAIN. 
   
" POOR GUY GETS TO WORK, "
 HEY BILL SAW YOUR 
 FAT ASS ON THE NEWS. 
   
" OH, I KNOW. "
   
 WE'RE NEVER SATISFIED WHEN 
 IT COMES TO FOOD. 
 YOU KNOW WHAT'D BE GOOD 
 ON THIS BURGER? 
 A HAM SANDWICH. 
   
 INSTEAD OF A BUN LET'S 
 USE TWO DOUGHNUTS! 
   
 THAT WAY WE CAN HAVE IT 
 FOR BREAKFAST.   
" LOOK OUT MCGRIDDLE, HERE COMES "
 THE DOUGHNUT HAM HAMBURGER! 
   
   
" YOU GUYS LAUGH, BUT YOU KNOW "
 THERE'S SOMEONE AT DUNKIN' 
" DONUTS GOING, THAT'S "
 NOT A BAD IDEA. 
 THEN WE CAN HAVE THE DIET 
 DOUGHNUT HAM HAMBURGER. 
 CAUSE WE NEED THE VARIETY. 
 I BOUGHT SOME PEANUT 
 BUTTER RECENTLY. 
" THERE WAS CREAMY, CHUNKY, EXTRA "
" CHUNKY, AND NOW EXTREME "
 CHUNKY PEANUT BUTTER. 
 I BOUGHT THE EXTREME CHUNKY. 
 I OPENED IT UP. 
 IT WAS JUST PEANUTS. 
   
" THAT IS EXTREME, TRYING "
 TO SPREAD THAT STUFF. 
" AW, THIS IS RADICAL! "
   
" THOSE EXTREME PRODUCTS, YOU FEEL "
 LIKE A COWARD EATING THE 
 REGULAR STUFF. 
 HEY CHECK OUT THAT PUSS EATING 
 THE REGULAR DORITOS. 
   
 CAN'T HANDLE THE EXTREME ONES. 
 I'M WORKING MY WAY-- 
 YOU GOT SERVED SUCKER! 
   
 (AS AUDIENCE MEMBER) THAT JOKE 
 DIDN'T EVEN MAKE SENSE. 
 HE'S WEIRD. 
   
 WE WANT OUR FOOD 
" FAST, DON'T WE? "
 THAT'S WHY WE REALLY LOVE 
 THOSE VALUE MEALS. 
 JUST HAVE TO SAY A NUMBER. 
 TWO! 
   
 SOON YOU WON'T HAVE TO SPEAK. 
 IT'LL JUST BE A NOISE. 
 EH! 
   
 EHHHH! 
   
" ALL RIGHT, I'LL SUPERSIZE IT. "
   
 WE NEED OUR FOOD FAST. THAT'S 
 THE REAL APPEAL OF CHINESE 
" FOOD, YOU KNOW? "
 BUT CHINESE FOOD ALMOST 
 COMES TOO QUICKLY. 
" YOU'RE LIKE, YEAH I WILL "
" HAVE, OH THERE IT IS! "
   
 HOW'D YOU KNOW I EVEN 
 WANTED THAT? 
" FAST AS TO PREPARE, "
 SLOW AS TO EAT. 
 I PREFER THE CHINESE RESTAURANTS 
 THAT HAVE THE 
 SILVERWARE ON THE TABLE 
 ON YOU ARRIVE. 
 CAUSE THERE'S NOTHING MORE 
 HUMILIATING THAN STARTING WITH 
 CHOPSTICKS AND HAVING TO TURN 
 TO THE WAITER AND BE 
" LIKE, OH YEAH, HI. "
 I'M TOO WHITE. 
   
 DO YOU HAVE A SHOVEL 
 BACK THERE? 
 CHOPSTICKS ARE FUN 
 BUT I'D RATHER 
 EAT THAN PLAY OPERATION. 
   
 YEAH. 
   
 (AS AUDIENCE MEMBER) 
 HE'S WEIRD. 
 (AS HIMSELF) WE'RE LAZY 
 ABOUT OUR FOOD. 
 WE HAVE PEOPLE DELIVER 
 IT TO US. 
" YEAH, I LIKE YOUR FOOD. "
 JUST NOT ENOUGH TO GO DOWN 
 THERE AND GET IT. 
   
 DELIVERY IS REALLY A COMBINATION 
 OF MY TWO FAVORITE 
 ACTIVITIES. 
 EATING AND NOT MOVING. 
   
 WORST PART OF DELIVERY 
 IS GETTING UP AND 
 ANSWERING THE DOOR. 
   
" OH, THIS IS A PAIN IN THE ASS. "
   
 WHO AM I THE BUTLER? 
   
 AT LEAST I DON'T HAVE 
 TO PUT ON PANTS. 
   
 HAND IT OVER. 
 WE'RE GETTING LAZIER. 
 IT'S JUST A MATTER OF TIME. 
" YEAH, I WANT DELIVERY AND "
 I'M GOING TO NEED 
 SOMEONE TO FEED ME. 
   
" NO, NO I'LL BE IN THE TUB. "
   
" YEAH, KEY IS UNDER THE MAT. "
 CHIP CHOP CHIP. 
   
 (AS AUDIENCE MEMBER) 
 CHIP CHOP CHIP? 
   
 (AS AUDIENCE MEMBER) I DON'T 
 EVEN KNOW WHAT CHIP CHOP CHIP 
 IS SUPPOSED TO MEAN. 
 (AS HIMSELF) I'M NOT GOOD 
 AT ORDERING DELIVERY. 
" I ALWAYS THINK I'M READY, "
 I NEVER AM. 
 I ALWAYS GET THAT ORDER PANIC. 
" DELIVERY, WHAT DO YOU WANT? "
" UH-UH UH, YOU GOT FOOD THERE? "
" YES WE HAVE FOOD, WHAT "
 DO YOU WANT? 
" UH-UH-UH, LET ME WRITE IT "
 DOWN I'LL CALL YOU BACK. 
   
 OH I WASN'T READY FOR 
 THE TRICK QUESTIONS. 
   
 IT'S EXCITING WHEN 
 THAT DELIVERY GUY 
" ARRIVES, ISN'T IT? "
 IT'S LIKE SANTA COMING 
 TO YOUR HOUSE. 
   
" HE'S HERE, HE'S HERE! "
" THE GUY'S HERE, WHAT DO WE DO? "
 WHAT DO WE DO? 
   
 BUT WE DON'T TREAT 
 HIM LIKE SANTA. 
 WE TREAT THE SITUATION LIKE 
 IT'S A HOSTAGE EXCHANGE. 
   
" WOAH, WOAH WEIRDO, YOU "
 WAIT OUT THERE. 
   
 HERE'S THE DEAL. 
" I'LL GIVE YOU THE MONEY, "
 YOU HAND OVER THE FOOD. 
 THEN I WANT YOU TO 
 BACK AWAY SLOWLY. 
   
 I DON'T NEED YOU CASING 
 THE JOINT. 
 (AS AUDIENCE MEMBER) 
 THAT'S RIDICULOUS. 
   
 HERE'S SOMETHING FUN TO DO NEXT 
 TIME YOU GET DELIVERY. 
 TREAT THE DELIVERY GUY LIKE 
 HE'S YOUR WAITER. 
" BE LIKE, HEY, THANKS A LOT COULD "
 YOU DO SOMETHING ABOUT 
 THE MUSIC IN HERE? 
   
 I COULD GO FOR SOME 
 MORE ICE WATER. 
   
 (AS AUDIENCE MEMBER) 
 HE'S WEIRD. 
 (AS HIMSELF) I NEVER KNOW WHAT 
 TO DO WITH ALL THOSE CONDIMENT 
 PACKETS THEY GIVE WHEN 
 YOU GET DELIVERY. 
 THEY GIVE YOU LIKE 
 50 KETCHUPS. 
 SUCH A WASTE. 
" MY WIFE'S ALWAYS LIKE, "
 SAVE THEM. 
 IT'S NOT LIKE YOU CAN GO UP TO 
" A HOMELESS GUY, CASE YOU GET "
" THAT FOOD YOU'RE LOOKING FOR, "
 HERE'S SOME KETCHUP. 
   
 I'M LOOKING OUT FOR YOU BUDDY. 
   
 (AS AUDIENCE MEMBER) 
 HE'S RIDICULOUS. 
 (AS HIMSELF) IT IS CONVENIENT 
 THOUGH. 
 WE WANT OUR FOOD EASY. 
 I MEAN HOW ELSE WOULD YOU 
 EXPLAIN SPRAY CHEESE? 
   
" I MEAN I'M LAZY, BUT I GUESS "
 THERE'S SOME PEOPLE THAT ARE 
" LIKE, YOU KNOW I LIKE CHEESE BUT "
 IT'S JUST TOO MUCH WORK. 
   
 TIRED OF OPENING IT 
" UP, TAKING IT OUT. "
 I'D BE WILLING TO EAT CHEESE 
" IF I COULD DO, "
" I DON'T KNOW, THIS. "
   
 HERE'S THE DEAL. 
 I'LL DO THIS AND THE CHEESE 
 WILL SPRAY OUT AND I COULD 
 WRITE MY NAME WITH IT. 
   
 CAUSE I GOTTA SIGN SOME CHECKS 
 TO MAYOR MCCHEESE. 
   
 AND AS YOU KNOW HE ONLY 
 TAKES CHEESE CHECKS. 
   
 (AS AUDIENCE MEMBER) I DON'T 
 EVEN KNOW IF THAT'S ACCURATE. 
   
 (AS AUDIENCE MEMBER) I DON'T 
 KNOW MUCH ABOUT MAYOR 
" MCCHEESE, BUT I DON'T THINK "
 HE EVEN TAKES CHECKS. 
   
 I LOVE CHEESE. 
 I THINK I'M LACTOSE 
 INTOLERANT THOUGH. 
 CAUSE LAST NIGHT I HAD 
 FOUR MILKSHAKES 
 AND I FELT LIKE CRAP. 
   
 I THINK IT'S THE LACTOSE. 
 IF YOU ARE LACTOSE INTOLERANT 
 DON'T BE ASHAMED. 
 JUST BECAUSE YOUR TUMMY CAN'T 
 HANDLE THAT SPICY MILK. 
   
" UH, DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING "
 MILDER THAN MILK? 
   
" BUT NOT WATER, THAT "
 GIVES ME GAS. 
   
 YEAH. 
 TRYING TO LAY OFF DAIRY. 
 I BOUGHT SOME OF THAT COUNTRY 
 CROCK MARGARINE. 
 DIDN'T STICK IN THE 
 FRIDGE RIGHT AWAY. 
 IT TURNED INTO GASOLINE. 
   
 THAT'S GOT TO BE A TOUGH 
 PRODUCT TO MARKET. 
 BECAUSE NOT ONLY IS IT A BUCKET 
" OF WHIPPED GREASE, "
 SOMEONE HAD THE AUDACITY 
 TO CALL IT CROCK. 
   
 DO YOU THINK THIS IS BUTTER? 
 IT'S CROCK. 
   
 WE ALL TRY TO WATCH WHAT WE 
" EAT, BECAUSE WE'RE ALSO SO "
 CONSUMED WITH OUR BODIES. 
 SO AT THE GYM I SAW THIS 
 WOMAN WORKING OUT. 
 YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE HER RIBS. 
" AND ALL I COULD THINK IS, I "
 HADN'T HAD A MCRIB IN FOREVER. 
   
 DELICIOUS. 
   
 (AS AUDIENCE MEMBER) THANKS 
 FOR THE REMINDER. 
 THIS GUY'S OBSESSED ON FOOD. 
 (AS HIMSELF) I AM. 
 I TRIED TO RATIONALIZE 
 WHAT I EAT. 
 BUT THERE'S SOME FOOD THERE'S 
 NO REASON TO EVER EAT. 
 LIKE A CINNABON? 
" I MEAN, TELL ME THAT PLACE "
 ISN'T RUN BY SATAN. 
   
 YOU EVER EAT A CINNABON? 
 YOU HAVE TO TAKE A NAP 
 HALFWAY THROUGH. 
   
 I THINK I NEED SOME INSULIN. 
   
 AND A WHEELBARROW FOR 
 MY HALF OF BUN. 
   
 IT'S KIND OF GENEROUS 
 CALLING THAT A BUN. 
 IT'S THE SIZE OF A 
 BEANBAG CHAIR. 
   
 SHOULD I SIT IN IT OR EAT IT? 
   
 HEY I COULD SIT IN 
 IT AND EAT IT. 
   
" OH, THIS IS STICKY "
 WITHOUT PANTS ON. 
   
 (AS AUDIENCE MEMBER) 
 HE HAS HIS PANTS 
 OFF IN A LOT OF JOKES. 
   
   
 HOW ABOUT THAT-- 
 HOW ABOUT THAT CINNABON ODOR? 
 YOU EVER BEEN WALKING THROUGH 
" THE MALL, YOU'RE LIKE, WHAT'S "
 THAT SMELL? 
 OH I JUST GOT A CAVITY. 
   
 DAMN CINNABONS. 
   
" TELL YA, I'VE DONE SOME "
" HUMILIATING THINGS, BUT "
 STANDING IN THAT CINNABON 
 LINE IS UP THERE. 
 EVERYONE'S SO FILLED 
 WILL SHAME. 
   
 NO ONE'S TRYING TO 
 MAKE EYE CONTACT. 
   
" UH, I'M JUST HERE "
 FOR THE NAPKINS. 
   
 I'M NOT A PIG LIKE YOU GUYS. 
   
 CAUSE THERE'S NO REASON 
 TO HAVE A CINNABON. 
 I'VE TRIED TO FIND ONE. 
 SO I'M ABOUT TO GET 
 ON A PLANE. 
 HOW ABOUT 8 POUNDS OF CAKE? 
   
 SOUNDS REASONABLE. 
 A LITTLE DESSERT ON THE GO. 
   
 THAT'S ONE THING THAT'S 
 TRULY UNIVERSAL. 
 WE ALL LOVE DESSERT. 
 YOU EVER NOTICE WHEN YOU GO OUT 
 TO DINNER THERE'S ALWAYS 
 SOMEONE THAT WANTS TO 
 SHARE A DESSERT? 
" HEY, YOU WANT TO SHARE "
 A DESSERT? 
 LET'S SHARE A DESSERT. 
 JUST GET YOUR OWN 
 DAMNED DESSERT. 
   
 OH I JUST WANT A BITE. 
 JUST A BITE. 
 AND THEN DESSERT COMES AND 
 THEY TURN INTO A VACUUM. 
   
" AH, APPARENTLY IT WAS A "
 BITE FROM A SHOVEL. 
   
" YEAH, I HAVE A BIT "
 OF A SWEET TOOTH. 
   
 NO YOU'RE A PIG. 
   
 BUT SO AM I. TAKES 
 ONE TO KNOW ONE. 
 I DO LOVE OUR EXCUSES. 
 I HAVE A SWEET TOOTH. 
 OH SO YOU'RE ORDERING IT 
" FOR YOUR TOOTH, THAT'S "
 INTERESTING. 
   
 BECAUSE IT'S GOING STRAIGHT 
 TO YOUR ASS. 
   
 I THINK YOUR ASS OWES YOUR 
 TOOTH AN EXPLANATION. 
   
 I MEAN NO ONE'S EVER REALLY 
 NEEDED DESSERT. 
 WHO WAS THE FIRST GUY THAT 
" WAS LIKE, THAT WAS A GOOD "
 MEAL WE JUST HAD. 
" I'M FULL, ARE YOU FULL? "
 YEAH. 
 YOU WANT TO EAT A CAKE? 
   
 LET'S EAT A CAKE. 
 LET'S EAT TIL WE THROW UP. 
   
 JUST KEEP GNAWING AND GNAWING. 
 WE HAVE DESSERT BECAUSE 
 IT'S SPECIAL. 
 IT'S ALWAYS SPECIAL DESSERT. 
 I LOVE WHEN YOU GO IN A TRUCK 
 STOP OR A DINER THEY ALWAYS 
 HAVE DESSERT AND THAT ROTATING 
 GLASS JEWEL CASE LIKE IT'S 
 SOME ARTIFACT OR SOMETHING. 
   
 HOWS THAT SUPPOSED TO WORK? 
" YOU'RE LIKE, YEAH I DON'T "
 FEEL LIKE DESSERT. 
 BUT WHEN I SEE PUDDING 
 AT THAT ANGLE? 
   
" AH, I GOTTA GET ME SOME. "
 MY FAVORITE DESSERT IS CAKE. 
 YEAH. 
 CAKE'S A TRUE SYMBOL 
 OF GLUTTONY THOUGH. 
 IF YOU EAT A WHOLE PIZZA 
" PEOPLE ARE LIKE, "
 WOW YOU WERE HUNGRY. 
 BUT IF YOU EAT A WHOLE 
 CAKE PEOPLE ARE 
" LIKE, YOU GOT A PROBLEM. "
   
 ADDICTED TO CAKE. 
 IT'S NOT LIKE DRINKING. 
" YOU NEVER HEAR SOMEONE BRAG, "
 YEAH LAST NIGHT I HAD FOUR 
 PIECES OF CAKE. 
   
 WHY ARE YOU TELLING US? 
   
 I JUST WANT YOU TO 
 KNOW I PARTIED. 
   
 WHY DON'T YOU GET 
 AWAY FROM ME. 
   
 CAUSE EVERYONE KNOWS 
 CAKE'S BAD FOR US. 
 SOMETIMES WE TRY AND DISGUISE 
 THE FACT WE'RE EATING CAKE. 
 IT'S BREAKFAST I CAN'T 
 HAVE CAKE. 
 I'LL HAVE A MUFFIN! 
   
 YOU KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN 
 A CAKE AND A MUFFIN? 
 NOTHING. 
   
 A MUFFIN IS A BALD CUPCAKE. 
   
 AND WE KNOW IT. 
 HAVE YOU SEEN THE 
 MINI MUFFINS? 
 HOW MUCH DENIAL ARE WE IN WHEN 
 WE'RE EATING MINI MUFFINS? 
 OH I'M JUST GOING TO 
 HAVE LIKE 1 OR 12. 
   
 SO SMALL THEY DON'T 
 REALLY COUNT. 
" THEY'RE LIKE, THEY'RE LIKE "
 MUFFIN VITAMINS. 
   
 WHEN I EAT THEM I FEEL 
 LIKE AN ASTRONAUT. 
   
 IT'S WHY I HAVE THEM FOR 
 BREAKFAST. CAN'T HAVE CAKE FOR 
 BREAKFAST. UNLESS 
 IT'S A PANCAKE. 
 HOW'D THAT SLIDE THROUGH? 
   
 YOUNG MAN YOU'RE NOT HAVING 
" CAKE FOR BREAKFAST, YOU'RE "
 HAVING FRIED CAKE WITH SYRUP 
 FOR BREAKFAST.   
 LOADS UP ON THAT AND 
 TRY NOT TO NAP. 
   
 PANCAKES. 
 PANCAKES DEFINITELY MAKE YOU 
 LOWER YOUR EXPECTATIONS. 
" YOU'RE LIKE, WELL IT LOOKS LIKE "
 I'M NOT SHOWERING TODAY. 
   
 I'M GOING TO BE DIGESTING THOSE 
 CARB CAKES FOR HOURS. 
   
 BAD IDEA. 
 THIS GUY TALKS A 
 LOT ABOUT CAKE. 
   
 CAKE'S A POWERFUL FOOD. 
 CAKE CAN ACTUALLY BRING 
 PEOPLE TOGETHER. 
 IT'S BILL'S BIRTHDAY. 
 I HATE THAT GUY. 
 THERE'S CAKE IN THE 
 CONFERENCE ROOM. 
" WELL, I SHOULD SAY HELLO. "
   
 SEE HOW HE'S DOING. 
" I MEAN, ADMIT IT WHEN YOU HEAR "
" THE SONG ""HAPPY BIRTHDAY"" ALL "
" YOU'RE THINKING IS, HEY I'M "
 GETTING SOME FREE CAKE. 
   
 DURING THE SONG YOU'RE JUST 
 WONDERING WHAT KIND IT IS. 
 (SINGS) HOPE IT'S CHOCOLATE 
 FOR ME. 
   
   
 WE'RE ALL BASHFUL WHEN WE'RE 
 OFFERED A PIECE AREN'T WE? 
" WE'RE ALWAYS LIKE, WELL "
 I GUESS I'LL TRY IT. 
   
" WHAT'S THIS CALLED, CAKE? "
   
 YEAH I'VE NEVER HAD 
 CAKE BEFORE.   
 YARRGGH! 
   
 IF HE DOES ANOTHER CAKE JOKE 
 I'M GOING TO KILL HIM. 
   
" OK, LET'S TALK ABOUT SOMETHING "
" BESIDES CAKE, PIE. "
   
 THAT'S LIKE LIQUID 
" CAKE, ISN'T IT? "
   
 PIE CAN'T COMPETE WITH 
 CAKE THOUGH. 
" PUT CANDLES IN A CAKE, "
 IT'S A BIRTHDAY CAKE. 
 PUT CANDLES IN A PIE? 
 SOMEONE'S DRUNK IN 
 THE KITCHEN. 
   
 GO CHECK ON GRANDMA. 
   
" PIE CAN'T COMPETE, YOU KNOW? "
 NEVER HEAR ABOUT A HOT CHICK 
 JUMPING OUT OF A PIE. 
   
 IT'S TOO MESSY. 
 I'M HERE! 
 GO TAKE A SHOWER. 
   
 CAKE. 
 THERE'S SO MANY TYPES 
 OF CAKE TOO. 
" THERE'S RUM CAKE, WHICH "
 MAKES SENSE. 
 BECAUSE WE'VE ALL BEEN EATING 
" CAKE AND THOUGHT, YOU KNOW, "
 THIS NEEDS BOOZE. 
   
 SHOT 'A LIQUOR. 
   
 I DON'T HAVE TIME TO 
 EAT AND DRINK. 
   
" I ONLY GOT TWO HANDS, "
" BUDDY, AND ONE OF "
 THEM'S HOLDING A CIGARETTE. 
   
 MEET ME HALF WAY WILL YA? 
" THERE'S FUNNEL CAKE, WHICH IS "
 ESSENTIALLY A GIANT FRENCH FRY 
 COVERED IN SUGAR. 
   
 THEY'RE SERVING THAT 
 AT THE IHOP NOW. 
 IT'S A WEIRD NAME 
 FOR THAT PLACE. 
 I'VE NEVER LEFT THERE FEELING 
 LIKE HOPPING. 
   
 IT SHOULD BE CALLED 
 I BARELY MOVE. 
   
 I NEED A WHEELCHAIR. 
   
 (AS AUDIENCE MEMBER) HEY 
" BUDDY, I LIKE THE IHOP. "
 AND IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT YOU 
 DON'T HAVE TO GO THERE. 
   
 I THINK THE MOST DISAPPOINTING 
 CAKE HAS TO BE 
 FRUITCAKE YOU KNOW? 
 YOU THINK THAT WOULD 
 BE BETTER. 
 IT DOESN'T ADD UP. 
" FRUIT, GOOD. "
" CAKE, GREAT. "
" FRUITCAKE, NASTY CRAP. "
   
 HAVE YOU TRIED FRUITCAKE? 
 I DON'T EVEN THINK THAT'S 
 FRUIT IN THERE. 
" YOU'RE LIKE (CHEWING), WHAT "
 IS THAT A SKITTLE? 
   
" WHAT IS THIS, SEED HERE? "
" WHAT'S THIS, A TREASURE MAP? "
   
 WHAT IS THE RECIPE 
 OF FRUITCAKE? 
 ANYTHING BUT FRUIT? 
   
 IT'S LIKE THE BAKER WAS JUST 
 CLEARING OFF THE COUNTER. 
 PUT ALL THIS CRAP IN THERE. 
   
 NOBODY EATS THIS STUFF THEY 
 JUST MAIL IT TO RELATIVES. 
   
 THAT IS SO TRUE. 
   
 BIG HOLIDAY TRADITION 
 FRUITCAKE. 
 I LOVE OUR HOLIDAY TRADITIONS. 
" LIKE THE CHRISTMAS TREE, WHERE "
 WE GO OUT AND WE CHOP DOWN A 
 TREE AND WE PUT IT IN 
 OUR LIVING ROOM. 
 KIND OF SOUNDS LIKE 
 THE BEHAVIOR 
 OF A DRUNK MAN REALLY. 
   
 SOME WOMAN WAKES UP. 
" HONEY, WHY IS THERE A-- "
 A PINE TREE IN OUR 
 LIVING ROOM? 
 (AS DRUNKARD) I LIKE IT. 
   
 (AS DRUNKARD) WE'RE GONNA-- 
 WE'RE GONNA 
 DECORATE IT FOR JESUS. 
   
   
 (AS DRUNKARD) AND THEN 
 I'M GONNA HANG MY 
 SOCKS OVER THE FIREPLACE. 
 FILL THEM WITH CANDY. 
 MAYBE I'LL TIE SOME LEAVES TO 
" THE CEILING, SEE IF I CAN GET "
 SOME ACTION. 
   
 (AS DRUNKARD) AND NOW I GOTTA 
 PUKE ON THAT COUCH. 
 MERRY CHRISTMAS. 
   
 SOME PEOPLE GET SO INTO 
 CHRISTMAS THEY 
 DECORATE THEIR YARDS. 
 IT SEEMS COMPLETELY BACKWARDS. 
" OK, CHOP DOWN THAT TREE. "
 BRING IT IN HERE. 
   
" TAKE ALL THESE LIGHTS, "
 PUT THEM OUT THERE. 
   
" OH, I JUST GOTTA-- "
 I REALLY GOT TO GET A JOB. 
   
 (AS AUDIENCE MEMBER) HE'S 
 ANTI-CHRISTMAS. 
   
 EASTER THAT'S A  
 WEIRD TRADITION. 
" EASTER, THE DAY JESUS "
 ROSE FROM THE DEAD. 
 WHAT SHOULD WE DO? 
 HOW ABOUT EGGS? 
   
" WELL, WHAT DOES THAT HAVE "
 TO DO WITH JESUS? 
   
" ALL RIGHT, WE'LL HIDE THEM. "
   
   
 I DON'T FOLLOW YOUR LOGIC. 
   
 DON'T WORRY THERE'S A BUNNY. 
 (AS AUDIENCE MEMBER) 
 THAT'S RIDICULOUS. 
 (AS HIMSELF) THANKSGIVING. 
" THANKSGIVING, IT'S LIKE WE "
 DIDN'T EVEN TRY TO COME UP 
 WITH A TRADITION. 
 THE TRADITION IS WE OVEREAT. 
   
" HEY, HOW ABOUT AT THANKSGIVING "
" WE JUST, UH, EAT A LOT. "
 WE DO THAT EVERY DAY. 
   
" OH, WHAT IF WE EAT A LOT "
 WITH PEOPLE THAT ANNOY 
 THE HELL OUT OF US? 
   
" (AS AUDIENCE MEMBER) OH, "
 HE'S ANTI-FAMILY. 
   
 MOSTLY WE USE HOLIDAYS 
 SO WE CAN EAT MORE. 
" I NORMALLY DON'T HAVE A BURGER, "
" A BRAT, AND A STEAK, "
 BUT IT IS FOURTH OF JULY. 
   
 AND I NEED THE ENERGY IF 
 I'M GOING TO START 
 BLOWING CRAP UP. 
   
 THAT'S WHAT THE FOUNDING 
 FATHERS WOULD WANT. 
   
 MY FAVORITE HOLIDAY 
 IS HALLOWEEN. 
 AND NOT JUST BECAUSE WOMEN USE 
 IT AS AN EXCUSE TO DRESS LIKE 
 PROSTITUTES. 
   
 YOU LADIES TOTALLY DO. 
 I'M A WITCH! 
 IF SHE WAS A HOOKER. 
   
 I'M LITTLE MISS MUFFET! 
 I'M SURE YOU ARE. 
   
" (AS AUDIENCE MEMBER) HEY, THAT "
 ALMOST SOUNDED DIRTY FELLA. 
   
 AS A KID HALLOWEEN 
 WAS AMAZING. 
 YOU DRESS LIKE A SUPERHERO. 
 YOU BANG ON YOUR 
 NEIGHBOR'S DOOR. 
 AND THEY GIVE YOU CANDY. 
 I DO THAT TODAY AND MY NEIGHBOR 
 WANTS ME ARRESTED. 
   
 PROBABLY BECAUSE I MAKE 
 A HOT CATWOMAN. 
   
 (MEOW) 
 KITTY WANTS SOME CANDY. 
   
 (MEOW) 
   
 (MEOW) REMEMBER THAT FROM 
 MR. ROGERS NEIGHBORHOOD? 
 MEOW MEOW MEOW MEOW 
 MEOW MEOW MEOW. 
   
 AND THEY WONDER WHY 
 WE DO DRUGS. 
   
 (AS AUDIENCE MEMBER) OH 
 THAT WAS NEGATIVE. 
   
 (AS AUDIENCE MEMBER) HOW ABOUT 
" THOSE TRADITIONS FELLA, WHY "
 DON'T YOU GO BACK TO THAT? 
 (AS HIMSELF) VALENTINE'S DAY THE 
 TRADITION IS WE GIVE EACH 
 OTHER THOSE BIG RED 
 HEARTS FILLED 
 WITH THE GAMBLE CHOCOLATE. 
 HAVE YOU EVER EATEN ANY 
 CHOCOLATE OUT OF THOSE BIG RED 
 HEARTS WITH ANY CONFIDENCE? 
   
 WELL THIS COULD EITHER BE REALLY 
 GOOD OR TOTALLY NASTY. 
   
 AND I'M JUST PIG ENOUGH 
 TO FIND OUT. 
   
" AW, I GOT THE ONE FILLED "
 WITH TOOTHPASTE! 
   
 I'M GONNA HAVE TO EAT 
 ANOTHER NINE TO 
 GET RID OF THAT FLAVOR. 
   
   
 THERE'S THE BIG RED 
 HEARTS FILLED 
 WITH THE GAMBLE CHOCOLATE. 
" OR THE TINY, CHALK, HEART "
 SHAPED ANTACIDS. 
   
" I KNOW I MAKE YOU NAUSEOUS, "
" HERE'S A TUMS WITH ""HUG ME"" "
 WRITTEN ON IT. 
   
 MAYBE THAT'LL HELP. 
   
 I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT 
 SAINT VALENTINE. 
 I ASSUME HE'S THE PATRON SAINT 
 OF OVERPRICED GREETING CARDS. 
 THAT'S AN ODD RITUAL REALLY. 
" YOU KNOW, WE GO OUT AND WE BUY "
 CARDS THAT ALREADY HAVE THINGS 
 WRITTEN IN THEM. 
" IT' IT'S LIKE, HEY, THAT'S "
 SOMETHING I'D SAY. 
   
 JUST ADD MY NAME HERE 
 AT THE BOTTOM. 
   
 (HUMMING) 
 HERE YOU GO! 
 -   
 YOU LIKE WHAT THAT OTHER 
 GUY WROTE IN THERE? 
   
 IT TOOK ME 5 SECONDS 
 TO FIND IT. 
   
 COST ME $2 BUCKS. 
   
 GREETING CARDS WOULD MAKE SENSE 
 IF THERE WAS SOMETHING 
 PROFOUND WRITTEN IN THERE. 
" BUT IT'S ALWAYS LIKE, "
 HAPPY BIRTHDAY! 
 COULDN'T THINK OF 
 THAT YOURSELF? 
   
 I'M NOT A SLOGAN MACHINE. 
   
 BIRTHDAYS. 
 EVERYONE ACTS A LITTLE 
 DIFFERENTLY AROUND THEIR 
" BIRTHDAY, DON'T THEY? "
 YOU EVER HAVE THAT FRIEND THAT 
 GIVES YOU THE BIRTHDAY ALERT? 
" HEY, JUST WANT TO LET "
" YOU KNOW, NEXT "
 TUESDAY IS MY BIRTHDAY. 
   
 JUST WANT TO LET YOU KNOW I'M 
 NOW GETTING YOU ANYTHING. 
   
 WE GIVE THE-- 
" THEY GIVE THE ALERT CAUSE, YOU "
" KNOW, THERE'S SO MUCH PRESSURE "
 IN OUR SOCIETY TO HAVE A GOOD 
 TIME ON YOUR BIRTHDAY. 
" YOU KNOW, IT'S LIKE, I CAN'T "
 BELIEVE I'M GOING TO WORK ON 
 MY BIRTHDAY. 
 I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M DOING 
 LAUNDRY ON MY BIRTHDAY. 
 I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M PAYING 
 FOR SEX ON MY BIRTHDAY. 
   
 RIP-OFF. 
   
 IT IS FUN GETTING 
" THOSE GIFTS, EH? "
 IT CAN BE HARD TO GIVE A GIFT. 
 IT'S A GAMBLE. 
" YOU KNOW, I-- "
 IT'S HARD. 
 I CAN'T BELIEVE WE'RE GIVING 
 CLOTHING AS A GIFT. 
 CAUSE WHENEVER YOU GET CLOTHING 
 AS A PRESENT YOU OPEN 
" IT UP AND YOU THINK, "
 NOT EVEN CLOSE. 
   
 AND THE PERSON THAT GIVES IT'S 
" ALWAYS LIKE, YOU CAN TAKE IT "
 BACK IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT. 
" THAT'S ALL RIGHT, I'LL "
 JUST THROW IT OUT. 
   
 DON'T GIVE ME AN ERRAND. 
   
" HAPPY BIRTHDAY, WHY DON'T YOU "
 HEAD TO THE MALL FOR ME? 
   
 IF YOU GET MY DRY CLEANING 
 THAT'D BE AWESOME. 
   
 I GOT A ROBE FOR CHRISTMAS. 
 I REMEMBER LOOKING AT THE ROBE 
" THINKING, WOW HOPE I GET THE "
 FLU SO I CAN WEAR IT. 
   
" I MEAN, WHO HAS THE TIME "
 TO ENJOY A ROBE? 
   
" WHAT ARE WE, ABOUT "
 TO SHOOT A PORNO? 
   
 IT'S A WEIRD PIECE 
 OF CLOTHING. 
 HOW'D WE EVEN COME 
 UP WITH THE ROBE? 
" WAS SOME GUY LIKE, HEY I GOT AN "
" IDEA, HOW ABOUT WE MAKE A "
 COAT OUT OF A TOWEL? 
   
 THERE COULD BE A BELT 
 THAT GOES AROUND. 
 YOU COULD DUNK THE BELT 
 IN THE TOILET. 
   
 BE A TOILET BELT. 
   
" THE INDOOR JACKET, THE ROBE. "
 YOU EVER SEE SOMEONE 
 OUTSIDE IN A ROBE? 
 THEY LOOK LIKE THEY ESCAPED 
 FROM THE LOONY BIN. 
   
" UH, JUST GETTING THE PAPER. "
 BEFORE THE MONSTERS DO RIGHT? 
   
   
 THE ONLY TIME I EVER WEAR A ROBE 
 IS WHEN I'M STAYING IN A 
 FANCY HOTEL. 
 YOU HAVE THAT ROBE 
 IN THE CLOSET. 
 I ALWAYS FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE WHEN 
 ROOM SERVICE COMES AND 
 I'M IN A ROBE. 
 LIKE I'M TRYING TO SEDUCE 
 THE ROOM SERVICE GUY. 
   
 HELLO WELCOME TO MY ROOM. 
   
 I'M IN MY ROBE AND HERE'S 
 THE BED I RENTED. 
   
 IS THERE ANYTHING I COULD 
 DO TO BE MORE CREEPY? 
   
" (AS AUDIENCE MEMBER) OH, "
 HE WAS BELIEVABLE 
 AS THE CREEPY GUY. 
   
 (AS AUDIENCE MEMBER) IT REMINDED 
 ME OF HIS CATWOMAN. 
   
 (AS AUDIENCE MEMBER) SCARY. 
 (AS HIMSELF) DO YOU EVER 
 GET A CANDLE AS A GIFT? 
" HEY, THANKS. "
 YOU KNOW I HAVE 
" ELECTRICITY, RIGHT? "
   
" LOOK, IF MY PLACE SMELLS "
 JUST LET ME KNOW. 
   
" NO, THIS PERFECT. "
 NOW I KNOW WHAT I'M GIVING 
 YOU NEXT YEAR. 
   
 THIS. 
 YOUR CANDLE GIFTS. 
 IT'S A GAMBLE WITH GIFTS. 
 YOU KNOW? 
 STATUE OF LIBERTY WAS A GIFT. 
" BIG BEAUTIFUL STATUE, GIFT "
 FROM THE FRENCH. 
 GOOD THING THAT STATUE'S 
 BEAUTIFUL CAUSE IF IT WAS UGLY 
 THAT WOULD HAVE AN AWKWARD. 
" FRENCHMAN WOULD COME OVER, "
 WHERE'S THE STATUE OF LIBERTY? 
   
" YEAH UH, THAT'S IN THE "
 DESERT IN ARIZONA. 
   
" YEAH, WE THOUGHT IT REALLY "
 COMPLEMENTED THE DESERT. 
   
 IT WOULD HAVE BEEN EVEN 
 MORE AWKWARD IF WE 
 REGIFTED THE STATUE. 
   
 WHERE'S THAT GIGANTIC STATUE? 
" UH, JAPAN WAS HAVING "
 A BIRTHDAY. 
   
 AND WE DIDN'T KNOW 
 WHAT TO GET THEM. 
 WE SAID IT WAS FROM 
 BOTH OF US. 
   
" AND THEY JUST LOVE IT, LOVE "
" IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT, "
" LOVE IT, LOVE IT. "
   
 MY FAVORITE GIFT I'VE EVER 
 RECEIVED IS A FLASK. 
 I THINK GIVING SOMEONE A FLASK 
" IS A NICE WAY OF SAYING, HEY "
 YOU SEEM LIKE A DRUNK 
 ON THE GO. 
   
 YOU STRIKE ME AS NEEDING HARD 
 LIQUOR AT ALL TIMES. 
   
 IT SHOULD BE GOOD FOR 
 YOU IN YOUR CAR. 
   
   
 DON'T YOU LOVE HOW WE HAVE 
 DIFFERENT CONTAINERS THAT WE 
 DRINK DIFFERENT ALCOHOL 
 OUT OF? 
" LIKE, YOU EVER TRY AND DRINK "
 WINE OUT OF ANYTHING BUT A 
 WINE GLASS? 
 YOU FEEL LIKE A DRUNK. 
   
" HEY, CAN YOU REFILL "
 MY YAHTZEE SHAKER? 
   
 HIT THE SIPPY CUP 
" TOO, WILL YOU? "
 DANKE. 
   
 SO MUCH FORMALITY WITH WINE. 
 LIKE THAT WINE MENU? 
 DOES ANYONE REALLY KNOW WHAT 
 THEY'RE LOOKING AT WHEN THEY 
 LOOK AT A WINE MENU? 
 BECAUSE IF YOU DO YOU'RE 
 AN ALCOHOLIC. 
   
" OH YEAH, I HAD THREE OF THESE "
 FOR BREAKFAST.   
 I ALWAYS MAKE THE MISTAKE OF 
 ASKING FOR THE WAITER'S 
 SUGGESTION. 
" YES, THAT WINE WOULD COMPLEMENT "
 YOUR MEAL. 
" YEAH, I'M GOING TO GO WITH "
 THE $5 BOTTLE   
 THAT COMPLEMENTS MY WALLET. 
   
 I AM ALWAYS ASKING THE 
" WAITER'S ADVICE, "
" WHICH IS ODD, YOU KNOW? "
" IT'S LIKE, YOU DON'T KNOW "
 ME BUT WHAT DO YOU 
 THINK I SHOULD EAT? 
   
 IS IT TIME FOR A HAIRCUT? 
   
 IT'S UP TO YOU CAUSE 
 YOU'RE A STRANGER. 
   
 AND I'M WEIRD. 
   
 YOU EVER HAVE THE WAITER 
 STRONGLY RECOMMEND SOMETHING? 
 YOU FEEL KIND OF GUILTY 
 NOT GETTING IT. 
 YEAH I KNOW YOU REALLY WANT ME 
" TO GET THAT, BUT I'M JUST "
 GOING TO GET WHAT I WANT. 
   
" CAUSE I'M STILL PAYING, "
 RIGHT PUSHY? 
   
 BACK OFF. 
   
 BUT WE SHOULD BE NICER 
 TO THE WAITSTAFF. 
 IT'S AN ODD RELATIONSHIP WE 
 HAVE WITH THE WAITER. 
 OCCASIONALLY THE WAITER WILL 
 TELL YOU THEIR NAME. 
 WE NEVER GIVE OURS. 
" THEY'RE LIKE, HEY "
 HOW YOU DOING? 
" I'M YOUR WAITER, "
 MY NAME'S PHIL. 
" YEAH, I'LL HAVE THE CHICKEN. "
   
 WHY DON'T YOU BEAT IT. 
   
 YOU NEVER REALLY USE THE NAME. 
" YOU KNOW, I'M OUT OF WATER. "
 PHIL! 
   
 PHIL! 
 WOO-HOO PHILLY! 
   
 I DO FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE 
 WHEN THE 
 WAITER'S DOING THE SPECIALS. 
 IT-- IT'S KIND OF A 
 SEMI-CONVERSATION. 
" THEY'RE ALWAYS LIKE, ALL "
" RIGHT, SPECIALS. "
 WE HAVE A SEA BASS 
 WHICH IS BROILED. 
" I'M ALWAYS LIKE, UH, AM I "
 SUPPOSED TO SAY SOMETHING? 
   
" UH, PASS! "
   
 I EXERT SO MUCH ENERGY ACTING 
 LIKE I'M INTERESTED IN THE SPE-- 
" HUH, THAT'S THE SOUP "
 OF THE DAY? 
   
 OH MY GOD! 
   
 I'M NOT GETTING ANY 
 OF THIS CRAP. 
   
" HERE'S A CLUE, IF IT'S THAT "
 SPECIAL PUT IT ON THE MENU. 
   
 (AS AUDIENCE MEMBER) 
 OH THAT IS SO TRUE. 
 (AS HIMSELF) I DO LOVE 
 GOING OUT TO DINNER. 
" YEAH, I ALWAYS GET "
 THE APPETIZER. 
 BECAUSE THE APPETIZER'S JUST AN 
 EXCUSE FOR AN EXTRA MEAL. 
   
 LET'S SEE I WILL START WITH 
 THE 80 BUFFALO WINGS. 
   
 AND DO YOU HAVE A LOW-CAL 
 BLUE CHEESE? 
   
 CAUSE I DON'T WANT TO 
 FILL UP TOO MUCH. 
   
 IT WOULD BE EMBARRASSING TRYING 
 TO EXPLAIN WHAT AN 
 APPETIZER IS TO SOMEONE FROM 
 A STARVING COUNTRY. 
" YOU'D BE LIKE, YEAH THE "
" APPETIZER, THAT'S FOOD WE EAT "
 BEFORE WE HAVE OUR FOOD. 
   
" NO, NO YOU'RE THINKING "
 OF DESERT. 
 THAT'S FOOD WE HAVE AFTER 
 WE HAVE OUR FOOD. 
   
" YEAH, WE EAT TONS OF FOOD. "
   
" SOMETIMES THERE'S SO MUCH, "
 WE JUST STICK IT IN A 
" BAG, BRING IT HOME. "
 YOU EVER GET THE DOGGY BAG? 
" YOU'RE LIKE, NO, NO PUT THIS "
" IN A BOX, IN A BAG. "
 AND I'LL BRING IT HOME AND 
 THROW IT OUT TOMORROW. 
   
 (AS AUDIENCE MEMBER) 
 THAT IS SO TRUE. 
 THAT'S WEIRD. 
 (AS HIMSELF) GOING OUT TO DINNER 
 IS A LITTLE WEIRD. 
 I MEAN I ENJOY BREAD IN EVERYDAY 
" LIFE, BUT WHEN I GO "
 OUT TO DINNER SUDDENLY 
 I CRAVE BREAD. 
   
 BREAD? 
 THEY'VE GOT BREAD HERE? 
   
" OH, WE SHOULD HAVE "
 BREAD AT HOME. 
   
 WE GOT TO GET THE RECIPE 
 FOR BREAD. 
   
 YOU EVER EAT THE WHOLE 
 BASKET OF BREAD AND 
 YOU STILL WANT MORE? 
 IT'S KIND OF AWKWARD 
 ASKING THE WAITER 
 FOR SECONDS ON BREAD. 
" YEAH, CAN WE HAVE SOME MORE "
 OF THAT FREE BREAD? 
 CAN YOU CANCEL MY ENTREE? 
   
 I'M JUST GOING TO LOAD 
 UP ON THE BREAD. 
 ARE THERE OTHER FREE 
 THINGS HERE? 
   
 I PREFER THE FREE STUFF MORE. 
   
 I AM TRYING TO LAY 
 OFF THE CARBS. 
" I'M VEGETARIAN NOW, ANYONE "
 A VEGETARIAN? 
   
" YEAH, VERY GOOD. "
 I'M NOT A STRICT VEGETARIAN. 
 I EAT BEEF AND PORK. 
   
 AND CHICKEN. 
" BUT NOT FISH, CAUSE "
 THAT'S DISGUSTING. 
   
 HOW CAN YOU TELL WHEN 
 FISH GOES BAD? 
 IT SMELLS LIKE FISH EITHER WAY. 
   
 WELL THIS SMELLS LIKE A 
" DUMPSTER, LET'S EAT IT. "
   
 NO ONE REALLY LIKES FISH. 
 THEY JUST WON'T ADMIT IT. 
" THEY'RE LIKE, I LIKE FISH, JUST "
 AS LONG AS IT DOESN'T 
 TASTE LIKE FISH. 
" I GOT NEWS FOR YOU, I DON'T "
 THINK YOU LIKE FISH. 
   
 I'M ALMOST POSITIVE FISH IS 
 SUPPOSED TO TASTE LIKE FISH. 
" ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW WHAT'S "
 REALLY GOOD ON FISH? 
 ANYTHING THAT KILLS 
 THE TASTE OF FISH. 
   
 HOW ABOUT RELISH AND 
 A GALLON OF MAYO? 
 THAT'LL DO THE JOB. 
   
 WHAT IF WE SQUEEZE A LEMON AND 
 WRAPPED IT IN SEAWEED AND 
 COVER IT IN SOY SAUCE. 
   
 (AS AUDIENCE MEMBER) 
 HE'S ANTI-FISH. 
   
 (AS AUDIENCE MEMBER) AND WE'RE 
 RIGHT NEXT TO LAKE MICHIGAN. 
   
 I AM AMAZED THAT WE'RE STILL 
 SERVING FISH WITH 
 THE HEADS ON THERE. 
 DON'T YOU ALWAYS FEEL LIKE THAT 
 EYE IS LOOKING AT YOU? 
" HEY, YOU DON'T MIND IF I WATCH "
" WHILE YOU EAT MY BODY, DO YOU? "
   
 DON'T BE DISTRACTED IF A 
 LITTLE TEAR COMES OUT. 
   
 YOU CAN JUST TELL YOURSELF 
 IT'S BUTTER. 
   
" (AS AUDIENCE MEMBER) OH, WHAT IF "
 A FISH WAS IN THE AUDIENCE? 
   
 (AS AUDIENCE MEMBER) 
 THAT WOULD BE 
 AWKWARD FOR ALL OF US. 
   
 (AS AUDIENCE MEMBER) IT COULD 
" HAPPEN, LAKE MICHIGAN'S RIGHT "
" THERE, BUDDY. "
   
 (AS AUDIENCE MEMBER) THE FISH 
 WOULD LAUGH BUT ON THE INSIDE 
 IT'D BE CRYING. 
   
 (AS AUDIENCE MEMBER) SAD. 
 YOU AND YOU'RE FISH HEAD JOKE. 
   
 OBVIOUSLY SOME PEOPLE 
 PREFER IT LIKE THAT. 
" YEAH, I'LL HAVE FISH. "
 KEEP THE HEAD ON THERE 
" AND, UH, FIND "
 OUT IF IT HAD A NICKNAME. 
   
 ANYWHO. 
   
 PIG ROAST. PIG ROAST WE 
 ALWAYS HAVE THAT PIG 
 HEAD SITTING THERE. 
" WHICH IS SAD, BECAUSE YOU CAN "
 TELL THEY KILLED THE PIG WHEN 
 IT WAS EATING AN APPLE. 
   
" HEY PIG, YOU WANT AN APPLE? "
" SURE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING "
 WITH THAT SPEAR? 
 OW! 
   
 MID-BITE EVERY TIME. 
 AT LEAST THOSE ANIMALS 
 AREN'T ALIVE. 
 I ALWAYS FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE 
 WHEN I GO INTO A SEAFOOD 
 RESTAURANT. 
 THEY HAVE THAT LOBSTER 
 TANK SITTING THERE. 
 ALL THE LOBSTERS ARE PEERING 
" OUT LIKE, HEY WHAT "
 ARE YOU HERE FOR? 
   
" UH, I'M HERE TO EAT YOU. "
   
 YEAH RIGHT. 
" HEY HARVEY, THIS GUY-- "
 HARVEY? 
   
 (AS AUDIENCE MEMBER) OH 
 AND HARVEY WAS GONE. 
   
 MY NIECE IS NINE YEARS OLD. 
 SHE INFORMED ME SHE'S 
 A VEGETARIAN. 
 I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE PULLED 
 THAT WHEN I WAS A KID. 
" UH, NO THANKS DAD. "
 I'M A VEGETARIAN. 
 NO SON OF MINE'S GAY. 
   
 EAT YOUR MEAT PUSSY. 
   
 (AS AUDIENCE MEMBER) HIS 
 DAD SOUNDED SCARY. 
 HE'S WEIRD. 
 (AS HIMSELF) YOU EVER EAT FAST 
 FOOD IN FRONT OF A VEGETARIAN? 
 THEY LOOK AT YOU LIKE YOU'RE 
 BARBECUING A KITTEN. 
   
 OH MY GOD YOU'RE EATING THAT? 
" YEAH, AND I'M NOT GOING TO "
 DIGEST IT FOR A DECADE. 
   
 COME ALONG WITH ME. 
 I DO LOVE THE 
 VEGETARIANS THOUGH. 
 I ALWAYS GET A KICK OUT 
 OF WHEN THEY TRY 
 AND IMPRESS YOU. 
" THEY'RE LIKE, I HAVEN'T HAD "
 MEAT IN FIVE YEARS. 
 I HAVEN'T HAD A BANANA 
 IN A MONTH. 
   
 YOU DON'T SEE ME BRAGGING 
 ABOUT IT. 
   
 DO YOU KNOW WHAT THEY DO 
 TO THOSE CHICKENS? 
" NO, BUT IT'S DELICIOUS. "
   
   
" DON'T GET ME WRONG, "
 I LOVE ANIMALS. 
 I JUST LOVE TO EAT THEM MORE. 
   
" FUN TO PET, BETTER TO CHEW. "
   
 I DO FEEL BAD THEY HAVE 
 TO BE KILLED. 
 I'D PREFER IF IT WAS LIKE 
 AN ANIMAL SUICIDE. 
   
 MAYBE THE ANIMAL DESERVED IT. 
 THIS IS A GOOD CHICKEN SANDWICH 
 I THINK THIS BASTARD 
 TRIED TO STEAL MY CAR. 
   
 GOOD WORK ROGER. 
   
 (AS AUDIENCE MEMBER) 
 WHO'S ROGER? 
   
 (AS AUDIENCE MEMBER) I WAS JUST 
 GETTING USED TO HARVEY. 
   
 I DON'T KNOW WHO SOME OF 
 THESE PEOPLE ARE   
 I CAN NEVER REALLY BE 
 A VEGETARIAN THOUGH. 
 I LOVE STEAK TOO MUCH. 
 STEAK'S LIKE THE TUXEDO 
" OF MEAT, ISN'T IT? "
 AND BOLOGNA'S THE 
 RETARDED COUSIN. 
   
" BECAUSE IF YOU'RE EATEN STEAK, "
 SOMETHING SPECIAL'S HAPPENING. 
" IF YOU'RE EATING BOLOGNA, "
 YOU MIGHT BE SPECIAL. 
   
" (AS AUDIENCE MEMBER) HEY, I "
 LIKE BOLOGNA JERK HEAD. 
 YOU ACT IS BOLOGNA. 
   
 (AS AUDIENCE MEMBER) YOU'RE 
 BOLOGNA HAS A LAST NAME AND 
 IT'S GAFFIGAN. 
   
 (AS AUDIENCE MEMBER) 
 BOLOGNA HATER. 
   
 WHENEVER I DO GET A STEAK I 
 ALWAYS GET A SALAD THINKING 
 THAT'LL BALANCE IT OUT. 
" YEAH, I'LL HAVE 20 POUNDS OF "
 MEAT AND 2 LEAVES OF LETTUCE. 
   
 COVER IT. 
 I DO LOVE SALAD. 
" WELL, I SHOULD SAY I LOVE SALAD "
 DRESSING WITH JUST A 
 TOUCH OF LETTUCE. 
   
 OTHERWISE YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE 
 EATING A BAG OF YARDWORK. 
   
 IT IS AMAZING HOW MUCH CHEESE 
 YOU HAVE TO PUT ON A SALAD TO 
 MAKE IT APPEALING. 
" YEAH, CAN I HAVE SOME MORE "
 CHEESE AND CAN YOU THROW IN A 
 SNICKER'S BAR? 
   
 INSTEAD OF THE LETTUCE CAN 
 I GET FRENCH FRIES? 
   
 WHEN YOU GO OUT TO DINNER 
 THEY ALWAYS TRY 
 AND IMPROVE THE SALAD. 
" THEY'RE LIKE, WOULD YOU "
 LIKE SOME FRESH 
 PEPPER ON YOUR SALAD? 
 CAN ANYONE TELL THE 
 DIFFERENCE BETWEEN 
 FRESH AND STALE PEPPER? 
   
 HEY WAIT A MINUTE! 
   
 THIS ISN'T FRESH PEPPER. 
 I GREW UP ON A PEPPER FARM. 
   
 SOME STALE ASS PEPPER. 
   
 I CAN'T EVEN TASTE THE PEPPER. 
" THEY MIGHT AS BE LIKE, WOULD "
 YOU LIKE US TO WAVE THIS 
 WOODEN WAND OVER YOUR SALAD? 
   
" UH, ALL RIGHT. "
" LA, LA, LA, LA LA. "
   
 ENJOY YOUR MAGIC SALAD! 
   
" OH, I DIDN'T KNOW I WAS "
 GETTING A MAGIC SALAD. 
   
   
" CAUSE REALLY, NONE "
 OF US WANT SALAD. 
 WE HAVE TO TRICK OURSELVES 
 INTO EATING SALAD. 
 YOU WANT A SALAD? 
" NO, NO. "
 YOU CAN GO TO THE SALAD BAR. 
 BAR? 
   
 ARE THERE GOING TO BE 
 WOMEN OVER THERE? 
   
 I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE APPEAL 
 OF A SALAD BAR. 
 I GO OUT TO DINNER SO I DON'T 
 HAVE TO MAKE MY OWN FOOD. 
 WHY WOULD I WANT TO 
 MAKE MY OWN SALAD? 
 HERE'S OUR SALAD BAR AND OVER 
 THERE'S OUR DISH-WASHING BAR. 
   
 AWESOME! 
   
 SOME OF THOSE ITEMS AT 
" THE SALAD BAR, TOO. "
" THEY'VE GOT LETTUCE, TOMATOES, "
 A TUB OF CHOCOLATE PUDDING. 
   
 WHO'S PUTTING CHOCOLATE PUDDING 
 ON THEIR SALAD? 
" WHAT IS THIS, FEAR FACTOR? "
   
 (AS AUDIENCE MEMBER) OH 
 THAT'S A GOOD SHOW. 
   
 (AS AUDIENCE MEMBER) I LIKE 
" THAT SHOW, IT'S NEAT. "
 (AS HIMSELF) IT'S HARD 
 TO EAT HEALTHY. 
" IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE, TOO. "
 SHOULD I HAVE THIS SALAD FOR $12 
 OR THESE EIGHT HAMBURGERS 
 FOR A NICKEL? 
   
 SORRY SALAD. 
   
 MOST HEALTH FOOD GETS 
 CORRUPTED ANYWAY. 
 LIKE THE GRANOLA BAR. 
 THAT'S BEEN 
 COMPLETELY CORRUPTED. 
 BECAUSE YOU KNOW INITIALLY SOME 
" GUY WAS LIKE, HEY KIDS "
" ARE EATING CANDY BARS, RIGHT? "
 ALL WE GOT TO DO IS SHAPE 
" GRANOLA LIKE A CANDY BAR, KIDS "
 WILL EAT THE GRANOLA. 
" AND THEN LIKE A WEEK LATER, UH "
" BILL, KIDS ARE NOT EATING "
 THESE GRANOLA BARS. 
" WELL, ALL YOU GOT TO DO "
 IS PUT CHOCOLATE CHIPS 
 IN THE GRANOLA BAR. 
 KIDS WILL EAT THE GRANOLA. 
" UH, BILL KIDS ARE PICKING THE "
 CHOCOLATE CHIPS OUT OF THE 
 GRANOLA BAR. 
 ALL YOU GOT TO DO WAS COVER 
 IT IN CHOCOLATE. 
   
 GET RID OF FREAKING GRANOLA. 
   
 I GOTTA TELL YOU HOW 
 DO EVERYTHING? 
 (AS AUDIENCE MEMBER) HE'S GOING 
 TO BE SUED BY KUDOS. 
   
 (AS AUDIENCE MEMBER) 
 WHEN DID THE MAFIA 
 GET INVOLVED IN GRANOLA? 
   
 (AS AUDIENCE MEMBER) 
 RIDICULOUS. 
 (AS HIMSELF) YOU EVER EAT A 
" KUDOS AND YOU'RE LIKE, WELL "
 MIGHT AS WELL FINISH 
 OFF THE WHOLE BOX. 
   
" IF I'M GOING TO EAT HEALTHY, I'M "
 GOING TO EAT REAL HEALTHY. 
   
" IT'S ALL RELATIVE, "
 EATING HEALTHY. 
" I MEAN I EAT KIND OF HEALTHY, "
 COMPARED TO SOME OF THE 
 ESKIMOS UP IN ALASKA. 
 THEY'RE EATING BLUBBER 
 UP THERE. 
 I'M PRACTICALLY STARVING 
 MYSELF ON MY CINNABON. 
   
" I'M MEAN, WHALE BLUBBER, "
 THAT'S LIKE EATING A 
" FAT GUY, ISN'T IT? "
   
 THAT'S WHY ALASKA IS PART 
 OF THE UNITED STATES. 
" CANADIANS WENT IN THERE, SAW "
 THEM EATING BLUBBER AND WERE 
 LIKE HUH THE AMERICANS 
 ALREADY GOT HERE. 
   
 (AS AUDIENCE MEMBER) HEY THAT'S 
 LIKE A GEOGRAPHY JOKE. 
 BUDDY I WOULD'VE BROUGHT MY 
 GLOBE IF I NEEDED IT. 
 IT'S RIDICULOUS. 
 I FELT LIKE THAT WAS 
 ANTI-ESKIMO. 
   
 I'M MOVING A LITTLE 
 SLOW TONIGHT. 
 I HAD A HOT POCKET FOR DINNER. 
   
 GOOD TO SEE I'M NOT THE 
 ONLY WHITE TRASH HERE. 
   
 I BUY THE HOT POCKETS. 
" I GO IN GROCERY STORES, I'M "
" LIKE, EH, I'LL GET THESE. "
   
 I'VE NEVER EATEN A HOT POCKET 
" AND THEN AFTERWARDS BEEN, I'M "
 GLAD I ATE THAT. 
   
" I'M ALWAYS LIKE, I'M "
 GOING TO DIE. 
   
 I PAID FOR THAT? 
   
 DID I EAT IT OR RUB 
 IT ON MY FACE? 
   
 MY BACK HURTS. 
   
 OW. 
 I WAS LOOKING AT A BOX 
 OF HOT POCKETS. 
 THEY HAVE A WARNING PRINTED 
 ON THE SIDE. 
" IT'S LIKE, WARNING! "
 YOU JUST BOUGHT HOT POCKETS! 
 HOPE YOU'RE DRUNK OR HEADING 
 HOME TO A TRAILER. 
   
" YOU HILLBILLY, ENJOY THE "
 NEXT NASCAR EVENT. 
 (SINGS) HOT POCKETS! 
   
   
 (AS AUDIENCE MEMBER) 
" I LIKE NASCAR, HE'S A JERK. "
   
 NEVER REALLY SEE THAT 
 ON A MENU WHEN 
 YOU GO OUT TO DINNER. 
 LET'S SEE I'LL HAVE THE CAESAR 
 SALAD AND THE HOT POCKET. 
   
" UH, TONIGHT'S SPECIALS, "
 WE HAVE A SEA 
 BASS WHICH IS BROILED. 
" AND WE HAVE A HOT POCKET, WHICH "
 IS COOKED IN A DIRTY 
 MICROWAVE. 
   
 AND THAT COMES WITH 
 A SIDE OF PEPTO. 
   
 IS YOU'RE HOT POCKET 
 COLD IN THE MIDDLE? 
 IT'S FROZEN. 
   
 BUT IT CAN BE SERVED 
 BOILING LAVA HOT. 
   
 WILL IT BURN MY MOUTH? 
 IT'LL DESTROY YOU MOUTH. 
   
 EVERYTHING'LL TASTE LIKE 
 RUBBER FOR A MONTH. 
   
 I'LL HAVE THE HOT POCKET. 
 (SINGS) HOT POCKET. 
   
" HOT POCKETS, YOU KNOW? "
 HAVEN'T BEEN AROUND THAT LONG. 
" LIKE, 10 YEARS? "
 HOW'D THEY COME UP WITH THAT? 
 WAS THERE SOME GUY IN A 
" MARKETING MEETING LIKE, HEY I "
 GOT AN IDEA. 
 HOW ABOUT WE FILL A POP-TART 
 WITH NASTY MEAT? 
   
 AND IF YOU COOK IT IN A 
 SLEEVE THING YOU COULD 
 DUNK IT IN THE TOILET. 
   
 (AS AUDIENCE MEMBER) 
 HE'S WEIRD. 
 (AS HIMSELF) 
 THERE IS THE VEGETARIAN HOT 
" POCKET, FOR THOSE OF US THAT "
" DON'T WANT TO EAT MEAT, BUT "
 STILL WOULD LIKE DIARRHEA. 
   
 (SINGS) HOT POCKET. 
   
 IT SHOULD JUST COME WITH 
 A ROLL OF TOILET PAPER. 
   
 (SINGS) DIARRHEA POCKET. 
   
 YOU EVER NOTICE THERE'S 
 NO DIGNIFIED WAY 
 TO BUY TOILET PAPER? 
 YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO BUY THAT 
 MULTI-PACK OF LIKE 18 ROLLS. 
 STICK IT IN YOUR CART. 
 EVERYONE IN THE STORE'S 
" LIKE, DOES THAT GUY "
 EVER LEAVE THE BATHROOM? 
   
 WHAT'S HE LIVING OFF 
 OF HOT POCKETS? 
   
 (SINGS) HOT POCKET. 
   
 THERE'S THE LEAN POCKET. 
 I DON'T EVEN WANT TO KNOW 
 WHAT'S IN THERE. 
   
 IMAGINE THE DIRECTIONS. 
" TAKE OUT OF BOX, PLACE "
 DIRECTLY IN TOILET. 
   
 (SINGS) FLUSH POCKET. 
   
" POCKET, POCKET, POCKET POCKET. "
 RECENTLY THEY INTRODUCED THE 
" BREAKFAST HOT POCKET, FINALLY. "
 I CAN'T THINK OF A BETTER 
 WAY TO START THE DAY. 
   
 GOOD MORNING! 
 YOU'RE ABOUT TO CALL IN SICK. 
   
 (SINGS) HOT POCKET. 
   
 NOW YOU CAN HAVE A HOT POCKET 
" FOR BREAKFAST, A HOT POCKET "
 FOR LUNCH AND BE 
 DEAD BY DINNER. 
 (SINGS) DEAD POCKET. 
   
 I DO LOVE THAT JINGLE. 
 DO YOU THINK THEY WORKED 
 HARD ON THAT SONG? 
" WHAT DO YOU GOT SO FAR, BILL? "
" UH, UH. "
 (SINGS) HOT POCKET. 
   
 THAT'S GOOD. 
 THAT'S VERY GOOD. 
" NOT AS GOOD AS YOUR ""BY MENNEN,"" "
 BUT IT'S GOOD. 
   
 NOW WHAT ARE WE GOING 
 TO RUN IN MEXICO? 
 (SINGS) CALIENTE POCKET. 
   
 YOU'VE GOT A GIFT MY FRIEND. 
 DON'T HIDE THAT IN A 
 BUSHEL BASKET! 
 (SINGS) HOT POCKET. 
   
 I SAW A COMMERCIAL FOR A CHICKEN 
 POT PIE HOT POCKET. 
 NOW THEY'RE JUST MESSING 
 WITH US. 
 IT'S JUST A MATTER OF TIME. 
 HAVE YOU TRIED THE HOT 
 POCKET HOT POCKET? 
   
 IT'S A HOT POCKET FILLED 
 WITH A HOT POCKET. 
   
 TASTES JUST LIKE A HOT POCKET. 
   
 I'M GOING TO AN STICK MY HEAD IN 
 THE MICROWAVE. HOT POCKET! 
   
 (AS AUDIENCE MEMBER) 
 HE WENT CRAZY UP THERE. 
 I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT HE WAS 
 DOING AT THE END THERE. 
 I THOUGHT HE WAS ON DRUGS 
 OR SOMETHING. 
 VERY WEIRD. 
 (AS HIMSELF) I UH-- 
 I AM ALSO AN ACTOR. 
 BUT I UH-- 
" I WISH I WAS A FILM DIRECTOR, "
 JUST IN EVERYDAY LIFE. 
 SO WHEN SOMEONE WAS TELLING ME 
 A REALLY BORING STORY I COULD 
" JUST GO, AND CUT. "
   
 I DIDN'T FINISH. 
 WE GOT IT! 
   
 THAT'S A WRAP. 
 THAT WOULD COME IN HANDY. 
 YOU COME HOME LATE. 
" YOUR WIFE'S LIKE, WHERE "
 THE HELL WERE YOU? 
 AND CUT. 
   
" OK, LET'S TRY IT AGAIN. "
 THIS TIME YOU DON'T 
 CARE WHERE I WAS. 
   
 IN FACT YOU'RE HAPPY 
 TO SEE ME. 
 LET'S TRY IT TOPLESS. 
 ACTION! 
   
 (AS AUDIENCE MEMBER) 
 HE'S A JERK. 
 THAT GUY'S A JERK. 
 (AS HIMSELF) 
 I DO HAVE A WIFE. 
 I GOT MARRIED. 
 MY WIFE CHANGED HER NAME. 
 I KNOW SOME WOMEN HAVE 
 A PROBLEM WITH THAT. 
 BUT I WANTED HER TO HAVE MY 
 OLD GIRLFRIEND'S NAME. 
   
 SO CALL ME OLD FASHIONED. 
 BUT THIS FELLA DOES WHAT 
 THE BIBLE TELLS HIM. 
   
 (AS AUDIENCE MEMBER) 
 THE BIBLE DOESN'T 
 SAY THAT AT ALL. 
 HE'S DUMB AS A ROCK. 
   
 I DON'T THINK MY WIFE'S PARENTS 
 LIKE ME THOUGH. 
 BECAUSE APPARENTLY WHEN YOU MEET 
 SOMEONE'S MOTHER YOU'RE 
 NOT SUPPOSED TO HUG HER 
" AND GO, OH YEAH. "
   
 THIS FEELS RIGHT. 
   
" AND IF THEIR DAD'S SHORT, DON'T "
 TRY AND PICK HIM UP. 
   
 OH YOU'RE LIKE A LITTLE 
 BABY DADDY. 
   
 IT'S A BABY DADDY. 
 WHEE! 
   
 (AS AUDIENCE MEMBER) 
 STRANGE. 
 I DO LOVE BEING MARRIED. 
" I HATED BEING SINGLE, "
 YOU KNOW? 
 THE WORST IS WHEN YOU 
 ASK SOMEONE OUT AND 
 THEY TURN YOU DOWN. 
 CAUSE REALLY WHAT THEY'RE SAYING 
" IS, YOU KNOW WHAT? "
 I DON'T EVEN FEEL LIKE EATING 
 A FREE MEAL AROUND YOU. 
   
 YOU MAKE ME WANT TO 
 GO ON A DIET. 
   
 (AS AUDIENCE MEMBER) 
 IT ALWAYS GOES BACK 
 TO FOOD WITH HIM. 
 SAD. 
 IT'S AN ISSUE. 
 (AS HIMSELF) 
 I LOVE MY WIFE. 
 BUT RECENTLY SHE HAS 
 GOTTEN VERY LAZY. 
 OR AS SHE DESCRIBES 
" IT, PREGNANT. "
   
 I'M EIGHT MONTHS PREGNANT. 
 DOESN'T MEAN YOU CAN'T MOVE 
 THOSE CINDER BLOCKS. 
   
 (AS AUDIENCE MEMBER) 
" OK, HE BETTER BE JOKING. "
   
 (AS AUDIENCE MEMBER) 
 CAUSE THAT AIN'T FUNNY FELLA. 
   
 PREGNANCY IS AN AMAZING 
" SACRIFICE, ISN'T IT? "
 OCCASIONALLY MY WIFE 
 DOES COMPLAIN. 
" YOU KNOW, I'M TIRED, "
 I'M HUNGRY 
" I'M COLD, "
 LET ME BACK INSIDE. 
   
" MOVE THOSE CINDER BLOCKS, "
 I'LL LET YOU BACK IN. 
   
 A DEAL'S A DEAL. 
   
 WE ALREADY HAVE ONE DAUGHTER. 
 WE DID A HOME BIRTH. 
" IF YOU'RE UNFAMILIAR WITH THAT, "
 THAT MEANS YOU TAKE THE 
 HUNDREDS OF YEARS OF MEDICAL 
 KNOWLEDGE AND 
 JUST THROW THAT AWAY. 
   
 AND YOU WING IT! 
" HEY, I CAN'T PROGRAM A VCR. "
 I'M HERE TO HELP. 
   
 WHERE WOULD YOU LIKE ME 
 TO STAND TERRIFIED? 
   
 CAUSE THAT WILL BE 
 MY CONTRIBUTION. 
 I DID LEARN A LOT. 
 I TELL YA. 
 I COULD NEVER HAVE A BABY CAUSE 
 I DON'T HAVE A UTERUS. 
   
" BUT EVEN IF I DID HAVE A UTERUS, "
 I DON'T THINK I COULD 
" DO IT, LADIES. "
 I DON'T THINK I COULD 
 HAVE SEX WITH A MAN. 
   
 UNLESS HE LOOKED LIKE ME. 
 THEN IT WOULD BE HOT. 
   
 SOME JIM ON JIM ACTION. 
   
   
   
 (AS AUDIENCE MEMBER) 
 HE'S WEIRD. 
 (AS HIMSELF) 
 I DO LOVE BEING A DAD THOUGH. 
 PEOPLE TREAT YOU DIFFERENTLY 
 WHEN YOU'RE HOLDING A NEWBORN. 
 ESPECIALLY IN STRIP CLUBS. 
   
 (AS AUDIENCE MEMBER) 
 HEY THAT WAS A TRICK 
" JOKE, FELLA. "
   
 (AS AUDIENCE MEMBER) 
 IT WAS A TRICK ONE. 
" TRICK, TRICK, TRICK, TRICK, "
" TRICK, TRICK, TRICK. "
 (AS HIMSELF) 
 I DID NOTHING TODAY. 
 THAT'S MY FAVORITE ACTIVITY. 
" I, UH-- "
 SOME OTHER LAZY PEOPLE. 
   
 THERE YOU GO. 
 I LOVE DOING NOTHING. 
 YOU CAN'T TELL PEOPLE YOU 
 DO NOTHING THOUGH. 
" THEY'RE LIKE, WE WENT SHOPPING "
" TODAY, WHAT'D YOU DO? "
 I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING. 
" OH, WELL YOU COULD'VE "
 COME WITH US. 
 I'D RATHER DIE. 
   
 THAT'S WHY I LOVE RAINY DAYS. 
" YOU WAKE UP YOU'RE LIKE, WELL "
 IT LOOKS LIKE I'M NOT DOING 
 CRAP TODAY. 
 HUH? 
 IT'S TOO BAD. 
 I WAS PROBABLY GOING 
 TO GO KAYAKING. 
   
 CLIMB A GIANT ROCK 
 OR SOMETHING. 
 BUT NOW I'LL PROBABLY 
 JUST NAP. 
   
 YOU EVER NOT GO OUTSIDE ALL DAY 
 AND THEN WHEN YOU FINALLY 
 DO YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE 
 EXPLORING ANOTHER PLANET? 
   
 OH IT IS LOUD OUT HERE. 
   
 THE AIR MOVES AND 
" EVERYTHING, HUH? "
   
 AND IF YOU STAY UP LATE 
 ENOUGH THERE'S NO 
 PRESSURE TO DO ANYTHING. 
" YOU'RE LIKE, 3:00 AM "
 I'M NOT GOING TO DO 
 LAUNDRY LIKE A WEIRDO. 
   
 I'M GOING TO DOWNLOAD PORN 
 LIKE A NORMAL PERSON. 
   
 (AS AUDIENCE MEMBER) 
 THAT'S NOT NORMAL AT ALL. 
   
 IT IS CRAZY HOW THE INTERNET AND 
 EMAILS CHANGED OUR LIVES. 
 YOU EVER GET A HAND WRITTEN 
 LETTER IN THE MAIL TODAY? 
" YOU'RE LIKE, WHAT THE HELL? "
   
 HAS SOMEONE BEEN KIDNAPPED? 
   
" HUH, I'M NOT OPENING IT, IT'S "
 PROBABLY FILLED WITH ANTHRAX 
 OR SOMETHING. 
   
 AND EMAILS DEFINITELY MADE 
 SENDING REGULAR MAIL A CHORE. 
" YOU'RE LIKE, WHAT I STUCK IT IN "
" AN ENVELOPE, NOW I GOT TO "
 GO OUTSIDE? 
   
" WHAT AM I, A TRIATHLETE HERE? "
   
" WORK, WORK WORK, WORK, "
" WORK, WORK. "
   
 YOU EVER HAVE THAT FRIEND THAT 
 SENDS REALLY LONG EMAILS? 
" YOU OPEN THEM UP, YOU FEEL "
 LIKE YOU GOT HOMEWORK. 
   
 I CAN'T READ THIS 
 DISSERTATION NOW. 
 I'M GOING TO KEEP THAT AS NEW. 
   
 I NEVER EVEN READ THEM 
 HALF THE TIME. 
" I JUST HIT REPLY, SOUNDS GOOD. "
   
" DON'T WRITE BACK, EVER. "
 EMAIL IS SO EASY THOUGH. 
 EXCEPT WHEN I HAVE TO 
 WRITE AN EMAIL TO A 
 REALLY SMART PERSON. 
 I GET ALL TENSE. 
" I'M LIKE, GREAT, NOW I "
 HAVE TO BE SURE THIS 
 IS A COMPLETE SENTENCE. 
 GUESS I'LL CAPITALIZE 
 A LETTER OR TWO. 
   
 THAT'S A SYMPTOM OF BEING LAZY 
 WHEN YOU CAN'T QUITE 
 REACH THE SHIFT KEY. 
   
 UHHHH! 
 THEY GET THE IDEA. 
   
 THANK GOD FOR SPELL 
" CHECK, HUH? "
 SPELL CHECK SAVES 
 ME CONSTANTLY. 
 I GET SUCH AN ATTITUDE WITH 
 SPELL CHECK THOUGH. 
" LIKE, NO! "
 THAT'S A PERSON'S NAME 
 SPELL CHECK. 
   
 SO ARE SO DUMB SPELL CHECK. 
   
 I WAS RIGHT. 
 YOU WERE WRONG. 
" OH, THAT IS HOW YOU "
 SPELL WEDNESDAY. 
   
 THANKS SPELL CHECK. 
 (AS AUDIENCE MEMBER) 
 HE WAS TALKING TO SPELL CHECK. 
   SPELL CHECK. 
 (AS HIMSELF) 
 I AM A HORRIBLE SPELLER. 
 YOU KNOW YOUR A POOR SPELLER 
 WHEN YOU'RE WRITING SOMETHING 
 AND YOU HAVE TO CHANGE WHAT 
 YOU'RE WRITING ABOUT BASED ON 
 THE WORDS YOU KNOW 
 HOW TO SPELL. 
   
" HMM, NO ONE'S HERE, "
 I'LL LEAVE A NOTE. 
" GUESS I'LL SEE YOU, "
 TOMOR-- TOMORR-- 
 NEXT WEEK. 
   
 I GOT TO GET SPELL CHECK 
 FOR THIS PEN. 
   
 (AS AUDIENCE MEMBER) 
 THIS GUY IS WEIRD. 
 (AS HIMSELF) 
 WE'RE ALL A LITTLE WEIRD. 
" BUT, YOU KNOW, WE LIKE TO THINK "
 THERE'S SOMEONE WEIRDER. 
 I'M SURE SOME OF YOU ARE LOOKING 
" AT ME GOING, WELL AT "
 LEAST I'M NOT AS WEIRD 
 AS GAFFIGAN. 
" AND THEN I'M THINKING, WELL AT "
 LEAST I'M NOT AS WEIRD AS 
 THOSE PEOPLE IN THE LOONY BIN. 
 AND THEN THE PEOPLE IN THE LOONY 
" BIN ARE GOING, WELL AT "
 LEAST I'M AN ORANGE. 
   
 (AS AUDIENCE MEMBER) 
" HEY, I LIKE ORANGES. "
 (AS HIMSELF) 
 THERE'S SO MANY WEIRD 
 SITUATIONS IN LIFE ANYWAY. 
 YOU EVER MIX TWO DIFFERENT 
 GROUPS OF FRIENDS? 
 THAT CAN BE STRESSFUL. 
 YOU ALWAYS FEEL LIKE YOU 
 HAVE TO PREP THEM. 
" YOU'RE LIKE, HEY YEAH UM, UH "
" THESE PEOPLE OVER HERE, UH, "
 THEY DON'T THINK I DRINK. 
   
 DON'T BE THROWN BY MY 
 BRITISH ACCENT. 
   
 GO ALONG WITH IT. 
 I LOVE WHEN I'M IN BIG CITIES 
 LIKE CHICAGO AND I SEE A 
 POLICEMAN ON A HORSE. 
" FOR A SECOND I'M ALWAYS LIKE, "
 DID CANADA INVADE? 
   
" WHAT'D, WHAT'D YOU COME "
 FROM A TIME MACHINE? 
   
 YOU EVER SEE THE POLICEMAN 
 ON THE HORSE? 
 THEY ALWAYS HAVE THAT 
" LOOK LIKE, WHY IS "
 EVERYONE LOOKING AT ME? 
   
 JUST ON A 2 TON ANIMAL IN 
 THE MIDDLE OF A HIGHWAY. 
   
 WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL? 
 YOU THINK THAT HORSE EVER 
 COMES IN HANDY? 
" THERE'S SOME ROBBERY, "
 YOU KNOW-- 
" COP, I'M GOING TO KILL EVERY-- "
" OH, IS THAT A PONY? "
   
 I LOVE PONIES. 
 CAN I PET YOUR PONY? 
 POLICEMEN ON THE HORSE. 
 THEY PROBABLY RARELY 
" GO UNDERCOVER, HUH? "
   
 CAN'T REALLY SEE THEM 
 INFILTRATING THE MAFIA. 
" (ITALIAN ACCENT) HEY, IT'S "
 VINNY THE HORSE. 
" VINNY THE HORSE, WHY YOU "
 ALWAYS ON A HORSE? 
 (AS AUDIENCE MEMBER) 
 THAT WAS THE WORST 
 ITALIAN AMERICAN 
 IMPRESSION I'VE EVER HEARD. 
   
 (AS AUDIENCE MEMBER) 
" HEY, IT AIN'T BRAIN SURGERY. "
 (AS HIMSELF) 
 I LOVE HOW WE MEASURE THE 
 DIFFICULTY OF EVERYTHING 
 VERSUS BRAIN SURGERY. 
 HEY IT AIN'T BRAIN SURGERY. 
 IT AIN'T BRAIN SURGERY. 
 WHAT DO BRAIN SURGEONS SAY? 
" LIKE, HEY IT AIN'T LIKE WE'RE "
 TRYING TO TALK TO WOMEN. 
   
 (AS AUDIENCE MEMBER) 
 HEY I'M A BRAIN 
" SURGEON, BUDDY. "
 AND I DIDN'T APPRECIATE THAT. 
 HE MADE ME UNCOMFORTABLE. 
 (AS HIMSELF) 
 I DO WANT EVERYONE TO 
 FEEL COMFORTABLE. 
 THAT'S WHY I'D LIKE TO TALK 
 TO YOU ABOUT JESUS. 
   
 (AS AUDIENCE MEMBER) 
 HE BETTER NOT. 
   
 IT DOESN'T MATTER IF YOUR 
 RELIGIOUS OR NOT. 
 DOES ANYTHING MAKES YOU FEEL 
 MORE UNCOMFORTABLE THAN SOME 
" STRANGER GOING, I'D LIKE TO "
 TALK TO YOU ABOUT JESUS. 
   
" YEAH, I'D LIKE YOU NOT TO. "
   
 WE COULD SAY THAT TO THE POPE. 
 I WANT TO TALK TO 
 YOU ABOUT JESUS. 
" YOU'D BE LIKE, EASY FREAK. "
   
 GOT TO KEEP WORK AT WORK. 
   
 YOU HAVE TO ADMIT THAT WAS A 
 GOOD IMPRESSION OF THE POPE. 
   
   
 (AS AUDIENCE MEMBER) 
 THAT'S RIDICULOUS. 
   
 I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT 
 THE BIBLE MYSELF. 
" I HAVEN'T READ IT, "
" BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE TO, "
 BECAUSE I'M CATHOLIC. 
   
 (AS AUDIENCE MEMBER) 
" OH, HE'S GOING TO HELL. "
 (AS HIMSELF) 
 NOT A LOT OF CATHOLICS 
 HAVE READ THE BIBLE. 
 IT'S A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE 
 ON RULES FOR CATHOLICS. 
 IT'S NOT LIKE OTHER RELIGIONS. 
 HINDUS ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO EAT 
" MEAT, THEY DON'T EAT MEAT. "
" CATHOLICS ARE LIKE, ONLY "
 EAT FISH ON FRIDAYS. 
 UNLESS YOU FORGET. 
   
" EH, DO WHATEVER THE "
 HELL YOU WANT. 
   
 WE'LL SEE YOU AT EASTER. 
 MY WIFE-- 
 MY WIFE'S REALLY CATHOLIC. 
 SHE'S LIKE A SHIITE CATHOLIC. 
 SHE'S ALWAYS WORRIED 
 ABOUT DIABLO. 
" SO I JOKE AROUND WITH HER, "
 I'LL CALL HER UP. 
" SHE'LL SAY, WHO IS THIS? "
" AND I'LL JUST GO, THE DEVIL. "
   
 SHE BRINGS ME TO CHURCH 
 EVERY SUNDAY. 
 IF YOU'VE NEVER BEEN TO A 
 CATHOLIC MASS THAT IS THE 
 LONGEST EXPERIENCE 
 OF YOUR LIFE. 
 MAKES YOU LOOK FORWARD TO 
 GOING TO THE DMV. 
   
 AT TIMES IT SEEMS LIKE 
 THEY'RE DRAGGING 
 CHURCH OUT ON PURPOSE. 
" (SINGS) AH, AH AH! "
" AH, AH AH! "
" AH, AH, AH! "
" AH, AMEN, ALREADY! "
   
 LET'S WRAP IT UP I'VE GOT 
 SOME SINNING TO DO. 
   
 TOO MUCH STANDING INVOLVED 
 IN CHURCH. 
 CAN'T I LIE DOWN AND WORSHIP? 
   
 WHILE I'M EATING A (SINGS) 
 HOT POCKET! 
   
 (SINGS) GOD POCKET! 
 I MOSTLY DAYDREAM IN CHURCH. 
 I ALWAYS HAVE THAT INTROSPECTIVE 
 LOOK IN MY FACE. 
" LIKE, HMM. "
 BUT ON THE INSIDE I'M 
" LIKE, DID I GO TO "
 WENDY'S TWICE YESTERDAY? 
   
 NOT A GOOD CATHOLIC. 
 I DON'T EVEN FEEL COMFORTABLE 
 WHEN SOMEONE'S PRAYING NEXT TO 
 ME IN CHURCH. 
" I'M LIKE, CAN YOU "
 DO THAT OUTSIDE? 
   
 I'M TRYING TO CHECK OUT SOME 
 OF THE LADIES IN HERE. 
   
 I DO HAVE THE DIRTIEST 
 THOUGHTS IN CHURCH. 
" I'M ALWAYS LIKE, PEACE "
 BE WITH YOU AND AN 
 EXTRA PEACE FOR YOU. 
   
 YOU DESERVE IT. 
   
 MY WIFE ALWAYS WANTS ME 
 TO GO TO CONFESSION. 
" DON'T GET ME WRONG, IT'S "
 NOT THAT I DON'T ENJOY 
 LYING TO A HOLY MAN. 
   
 I JUST DON'T KNOW HOW HONEST 
 PEOPLE ARE BEING IN THERE. 
 THEY GO IN THERE FOR LIKE A 
" MINUTE AND A HALF, YEAH I "
" LIED, I DOUBLE PARKED, "
 CAN WE WRAP THIS UP? 
 I'M MEETING A HOOKER. 
   
" YEAH, GRAZIE PADRE. "
 (AS AUDIENCE MEMBER) 
 IT'S SILLY. 
 (AS HIMSELF) 
 SEEMS LIKE SO MUCH AT CHURCH 
 IS MEMORIZATION. 
 I HAVE A HORRIBLE MEMORY. 
" I'M ALWAYS LIKE, OUR FATHER WHO "
 ART IN HEAVEN WITHOUT THE 
 APPROVED WRITTEN CONSENT OF 
 MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL. 
   
   
 I LOVE DOING THAT JOKE BECAUSE 
 THERE'S ALWAYS ONE FACING IN 
" THE AUDIENCE, YOU'RE "
 GOING TO HELL. 
   
 THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE I WANT 
 TO BUMP INTO IN HEAVEN. 
" BE LIKE, HEY REMEMBER ME? "
   
 YOU'RE HERE? 
   
 YEAH. PETER 
 LOVES MY STUFF. 
   
 I'M GOING TO BE DOING 
 A SHOW DOWN NEAR THE 
 PEARLY GATES LATER ON. 
 PEARLY GATES. 
 AM I THE ONLY ONE THAT FINDS IT 
 ODD THAT HEAVEN HAS GATES? 
 GATES? 
 WHAT KIND OF A NEIGHBORHOOD 
 IS HEAVEN IN? 
   
 WHAT DO YOU DIE AND YOU GO 
 TO A GATED COMMUNITY? 
   
 ARE THE GATES NECESSARY? 
" YEAH, WE HAD A LOT OF KIDS "
 SNEAKING IN USING THE POOL. 
   
 THOSE GATES WEREN'T EASY. 
" WE HAD TO GO DOWN TO HELL, GET "
 A CONTRACTOR AND EVERYTHING. 
   
 (AS AUDIENCE MEMBER) 
 HEY I'M A CONTRACTOR. 
   
   
 IN TV AND FILMS WHENEVER THEY 
 SHOW SOMEONE GOING TO HEAVEN 
 THEY ALWAYS SHOW THEM GOING 
 UP AN ESCALATOR. 
 LIKE HEAVEN'S IN THE 
 MALL OR SOMETHING. 
   
 HEY CAN WE STOP BY 
 ORANGE JULIUS? 
   
 (AS AUDIENCE MEMBER) 
 THAT PLACE ISN'T EVEN 
 OPEN ANYMORE. 
   
 I THINK RELIGION'S 
 FASCINATING. 
 ADAM AND EVE KICKED OUT OF 
 PARADISE FOR EATING AN APPLE. 
 AN APPLE. 
 WOULD YOU EVER HAVE BEEN 
 TEMPTED BY AN APPLE? 
" I'D BE LIKE, COVER IT IN CARAMEL "
 AND COME BACK TO ME. 
   
 YOU GOT CAKE BACK THERE? 
   
 I LOVE CAKE. 
" JESUS, OF COURSE, "
 WAS A CARPENTER. 
 WE ALL KNOW THAT. 
 YOU THINK JESUS WAS 
 A GOOD CARPENTER? 
 BECAUSE THE BIBLE DOESN'T 
 REALLY ADDRESS IT. 
" I MEAN, WHO KNOWS BACK THEN "
" PEOPLE COULD HAVE BEEN, GOOD "
 THING THAT MESSIAH 
 THING WORKED OUT. 
   
" YEAH, HE BUILT A SHED "
 FOR MY COUSIN. 
 WHAT A PIECE OF CRAP. 
   
" AND THE ENTIRE TIME HE'S LIKE, "
 I'M THE SON OF GOD. 
 WELL RIGHT NOW YOU'RE 
 BUILDING A SHED. 
   
" SO HOP TO IT, "
" ""HEY-ZEUS"". "
   
 WOULDN'T IT BE GREAT IF I WAS 
 ELECTROCUTED RIGHT NOW? 
    
 (AS AUDIENCE MEMBER) 
 HE DID A JESUS JOKE AND 
 HE WAS ELECTROCUTED. 
 (AS AUDIENCE MEMBER) 
 IT WAS THE BEST SHOW 
 I'VE EVER SEEN. 
   
 (AS AUDIENCE MEMBER) 
 AND IT'S HELPED MY FAITH. 
 I THINK IT'S FASCIN-- 
 I WOULD HAVE LOVED TO HAVE 
" OVERHEARD THAT CONVERSATION, "
 WHERE MARY EXPLAINED TO JOSEPH 
 THAT SHE WAS PREGNANT. 
   
 JOSEPH WASN'T THE FATHER? 
 JOSEPH? 
 - YEAH. 
" YEAH, UM UH. "
 YOU KNOW WE'VE NEVER 
 MADE LOVE? 
 YEAH. 
   
" YEAH UM ANYWAY, UH. "
 LAST NIGHT AN ANGEL 
 VISITED ME-- 
   
 AND NOW I'M PREGNANT. 
 JESUS CHRIST! 
   
" OH, YOU ALREADY KNOW ABOUT IT. "
   
 IT WOULD'VE BEEN HARD TO GET 
 JESUS A PRESENT BACK THEN. 
 CAUSE WHATEVER YOU GOT HIM AS 
 A PRESENT BACK THEN IT MUST 
" HAVE BEEN, OH PAIR "
" OF SOCKS, THANKS. "
 YOU KNOW I'M DYING FOR 
" YOUR SINS, RIGHT? "
   
" YEAH, BUT THANKS "
 FOR THE SOCKS. 
 THEY'LL GO GREAT WITH 
 MY SANDALS. 
" WHAT AM I, GERMAN? "
   
 (AS AUDIENCE MEMBER) 
 I'M OFFENDED ON SO MANY 
 DIFFERENT LEVELS. 
   
 (AS AUDIENCE MEMBER) 
 WHAT IF MOSES WAS HERE? 
   
 WE ALL KNOW MOSES LED THE 
 ISRAELITES OUT OF EGYPT. 
 THEY WANDERED IN THE DESERT 
 FOR 40 YEARS. 
 I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU BUT 
 AFTER A YEAR I WOULD HAVE 
" BEEN, THIS MOSES DOESN'T KNOW "
 WHERE THE HELL HE'S GOING! 
   
 I APPRECIATE HIM GETTING 
 US OUT OF EGYPT. 
 BUT WE'RE IN THE 
" DESERT, FOLKS. "
 AS IN NO AGUA. 
   
 (AS AUDIENCE MEMBER) 
 THEY WOULDN'T SAY AGUA. 
   
 AND AFTER MOSES PARTED THE RED 
 SEA DID HE SAY ANYTHING? 
" WAS HE LIKE, TA-DAH! "
   
 HOW ABOUT THEM APPLES? 
   
 THAT'LL STOP SOME OF 
 YOUR BITCHING. 
   
 (AS AUDIENCE MEMBER) 
 I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S 
 CHRONOLOGICALLY ACCURATE. 
   
 THIS GUY'S GOING TO HELL 
 IN TWO RELIGIONS. 
 HE'S PRACTICALLY 
 SPRINTING THERE. 
   
" DON'T WORRY, YOU KNOW GOD "
 HAS A SENSE OF HUMOR. 
 BECAUSE HE WAS TALKING TO 
 MOSES AS A BURNING BUSH. 
 A BURNING BUSH? 
 CAN YOU IMAGINE IF YOU WERE THE 
 FIRST PERSON MOSES TOLD 
 ABOUT THAT? 
" YEAH, GOD JUST TALKED TO "
 ME AS A BURNING BUSH. 
   
 SURE HE DID. 
   
 MOSES WE THINK MAYBE YOU'VE 
 BEEN BURNING SOME BUSH. 
   
   
 ALL RIGHT THAT IS ALL FOR ME. 
 THANK YOU VERY MUCH YOU GUYS.
