THANK YOU
THANKS.
OH, THANK YOU
ALL FOR COMING OUT.
THIS MAKES IT NICE, HAVING AN
AUDIENCE FOR MY SPECIAL.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
YOU KNOW, REMEMBER WHEN
YOU WERE A LITTLE KID,
AND YOUR FRIENDS WOULD
BE OUT PLAYING A GAME
LIKE COWBOYS AND INDIANS
OR FORT,
SOME GAME WHERE THERE
WAS, LIKE, FAKE BOUNDARIES ?
SO THEY WOULD SAY,
"OKAY, THE BIKE PATH OVER AT
THE SCAFFETYS' IS LAVA,
"AND IF YOU TOUCH
THAT, YOU'RE DEAD.
"AND THEN THE HEDGES OVER
AT THE SLINGERLANDS'
"ARE POISON SNAKES,
"AND IF YOU
GO OVER THERE,
"THEY'LL BITE YOU
AND YOU'RE DEAD.
AND THOSE ARE THE BOUNDARIES."
BUT YOU WEREN'T THERE
WHEN THEY STARTED PLAYING.
LIKE, YOU SHOW UP AN HOUR LATER,
'CAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO THE POOL.
YOU'RE LIKE, "HEY, GUYS,
I'M GONNA GO TO THE POOL."
AND THEY SAY, "HEY, DON'T TOUCH
THE BIKE PATH, IT'S LAVA !
DON'T-- THE HEDGES ARE SNAKES !"
AND YOU'VE GOTTA SAY,
"OH, I'M NOT--
"GUYS, I WASN'T HERE
WHEN YOU DID ALL THAT.
"I'M JUST GOING
TO THE POOL.
IT DOESN'T AFFECT ME."
DO YOU KNOW WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT ?
THAT'S PRETTY MUCH HOW I TREAT
THE POT LAWS IN THIS COUNTRY.
KINDA THE SAME WAY,
YOU KNOW, JUST THE WHOLE...
"PATTON, YOU CAN'T...
YOU CAN'T HAVE THAT,
IT'S ILLEGAL."
"OH, I'M NOT-- GO AHEAD.
"I WASN'T HERE WHEN
YOU DID ALL THAT.
"YEAH, I KNOW, OKAY,
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT, IT'S--
"I KNOW, IT'S LAVA--
IT'S JUST MARIJUANA.
"DON'T WORRY, SEE ?
IT'S FINE.
DON'T WORRY."
I LIKE-- WELL, I DON'T LIKE
READING THE OBITUARIES,
BUT I READ THE OBITUARIES A LOT,
BECAUSE IT
JUST SEEMS TO ME
THAT PEOPLE THAT WRITE
THE OBITUARIES
EITHER WANNA BE P.R. PEOPLE
OR THEY'RE FAILED P.R. PEOPLE,
AND THEY'RE TRYING TO
KEEP IT GOING.
"HEY, LOOK, I SPUN DEATH !"
FOR INSTANCE, IN THE OBITUARIES,
NO ONE EVER DIES OF CANCER.
PEOPLE ALWAYS GIVE IN AFTER
A VALIANT BATTLE WITH CANCER,
OR THEY THROW IN THE TOWEL
AFTER A COURAGEOUS FIGHT,
WHICH, STATISTICALLY,
THAT CAN'T BE POSSIBLE.
THERE HAD TO HAVE BEEN A COUPLE
OF COWARDLY ORDEALS IN THERE.
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN ?
LIKE "BOB SMITH DIED TODAY
"AFTER A CRAVEN,
COWARDLY ORDEAL
WITH CANCER,
"DURING WHICH HE
WISHED THE DISEASE
"ON HIS FAMILY AND FRIENDS,
"AND ATTEMPTED
A PACT WITH SATAN
"WHICH LEFT HIS BASEMENT
COVERED IN GOAT'S BLOOD
"AND FOUR BOXES OF
CHALK NEEDLESSLY WASTED,

"TRYING TO SUMMON A DEMON
WHO NEVER APPEARED.

"THE FEW MOURNERS WHO
SHOWED UP AT HIS FUNERAL

"HAD A HARD TIME
NOT GIGGLING.
GOOD RIDDANCE."
MY OTHER BIG OBITUARY FEAR
IS, WHEN I DIE,
THEY'LL HAVE MY PICTURE,
AND THEN THEY ALWAYS HAVE
UNDERNEATH IT, IN QUOTES,
"HE LOVED TO LAUGH."
OH, HE LOVED
TO LAUGH.
WELL, THAT DOESN'T
TELL YOU ANYTHING.
EVERYBODY LOVES
TO LAUGH.
YOU'RE LAUGHING.
THAT'S LIKE SAYING,
"HE HUNGERED FOR FOOD
"SO OFTEN IN HIS LIFE, HE GOT
THESE INSANE CRAVINGS.
"HE TRIED TO GIVE IT UP.
"HE'D HAVE A BIG BREAKFAST
AND SAY,
"'THAT'S IT, COLD TURKEY.'
"AND THEN AT LUNCH
HE'D WANT SOME COLD TURKEY.
"HE WAS PATHETIC.
"BATTLED IT ALONGSIDE OF
HIS SLEEP ADDICTION.
"OH, THAT SLEEP ADDICTION
WAS A MONKEY ON HIS BACK.
"HE'D GO 18, 20 HOURS,
BUT SOONER OR LATER,
"HE'D LOOK FOR A
'BED' TO 'LIE DOWN IN',
"AS THE CRAZY SLEEP JUNKIES
WOULD SAY IN THAT
"WEIRD STREET
LINGO OF THEIRS.
"'I'M GONNA GO TAKE A NAP.'
WHAT'S THAT
HEPCAT SAYING ?"
ALTHOUGH I CAN'T THINK
OF ANYTHING CREEPIER
THAN WATCHING SOMEONE
LAUGH WHO HATES TO LAUGH.
HOW DISTURBING WOULD THAT LOOK ?

LIKE, YOU TELL 'EM A JOKE,
AND THEY'RE LIKE,

"EH-EH-HEH--
OH, LAUGHTER !"

( grunting )
LOOK AT MY SET.

THEY BUILT
ME A SET.

OH, ALL THE MONEY.
I LIVE IN
LOS ANGELES RIGHT NOW.
I LOVE GOING TO, LIKE,
OLD MOVIES.
I'M A REAL FILM BUFF,
AND LOS ANGELES IS THE PLACE
TO GO TO A LOT OF MOVIES.
THEY SHOW
OLD MOVIES ALL THE TIME.
BUT UNFORTUNATELY,
YOU HAVE TO WATCH 'EM
WITH PEOPLE THAT LIVE
IN LOS ANGELES,
AND A LOT OF THEM--
THEY'LL GO TO THESE
OLD MOVIES,
BUT THEY'LL BRING
THEIR BULL ( bleep )
<i>STARBUCKS LIBERALISM
WITH THEM.</i>
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN ?
AS IF IT STILL
APPLIES TO THE MOVIES
THAT THEY'RE WATCHING.

LIKE I-- THEY WERE SHOWING
JOHN WAYNE'S "THE SEARCHERS."

"THE SEARCHERS," ONE OF
THE GREATEST FILMS EVER MADE.
<i>SO WE'RE ALL WATCHING IT AT
THE MANN'S CHINESE.</i>

"OH, MAN,
THIS IS AMAZING."

SO THE MOVIE STARTS UP.
THE FIRST TITLE COMES UP:
TEXAS, 1868.
TEXAS, 1868.
SO THIS WOMAN
TWO SEATS DOWN FROM ME
STARTS REACTING TO THE FILM
AS IF IT WERE MADE TODAY.
SHE STARTS GOING, "OH, WELL,
LET THE WOMEN CLEAR THE TABLE
"WHILE THE MEN JUST SIT
THERE AND TALK.
"OKAY, AND LET'S ALL BE RACIST
"TO THE INDIANS
WHILE WE'RE AT IT.
THAT'S GOOD."
UM, MA'AM ?
IT'S THE OLD WEST, OKAY ?
IT WAS SETTLED BY BIG, WHITE,
RACIST PSYCHOPATHS.
I'M SORRY.
THOSE ARE THE GUYS
THAT SETTLED IT.
<i>IT WASN'T
SETTLED GAP GREETERS</i>
<i>AJAMBA JUICE EMPLOYEES
ON THEIR BREAK.</i>
IT WOULD HAVE
BEEN NICE, BUT NO.
NO.
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING ?
"IF I HAD SETTLED
THIS COUNTRY--"

WE'D ALL BE
DEAD RIGHT NOW.

YOU'D BE DEAD.
'CAUSE I WOULD HAVE BEEN
OUT THERE, GOING,
"OH, MY INNER CHILD DOESN'T
FEEL LIKE CHOPPING WOOD TODAY.

I HAVEN'T--"

"WE'RE GONNA DIE,
YOU IDIOT !"
"I KNOW, BUT I WAS
READING ANDREA DWORKIN,
AND SHE SAYS THE MALES--"
"PLEASE KILL AN ANIMAL
SO WE CAN EAT !
PLEASE !"
WE'RE AT WAR, RIGHT ?
I'M ONLY SAYING
WE'RE AT WAR,
<i>BECAUSE I TURNED
ON CNN LAST WEEK,</i>
AND THERE WAS A GREEN
CITY ON TV.
<i>WHENEVER YOU TURN ON CNN</i>
AND THERE'S A GREEN CITY WITH
WHITE DOTS OVER IT, YOU'RE LIKE,
"OH, I GUESS WE NEED OIL.
"HEY, HONEY, WE SHOULD GO
FILL THE CAR UP.
OIL PRICES--"
AS I SPEAK TO MY WIFE,
WHO DOESN'T EXIST.
"HONEY, WE SHOULD
GO GET... THE..."
MY PHANTOM WIFE.
<i>THESE WAR REPORTERS,
TOO, FOR CNN--</i>
THEY TRY TO MAKE OUT
LIKE THEY'RE STILL THAT
WHOLE EDWARD MURROW--
"I'M IN LONDON WHILE
THEY'RE BOMBING US,"
OR "I'M IN THE JUNGLES
OF VIETNAM."
<i>THESE GUYS ARE IN A DAY'S INN,
MILES AWAY FROM THE SHELLING,</i>
STILL TRYING TO COME ON
LIKE THEY'RE KING SWAGGERCOCK.
"YEAH, I'M IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE WAR.
LOOK OUT !"
AND THESE GUYS TRY
TO PLAY IT UP, LIKE,
<i>"YES, WE'RE IN
THE DAY'S INN.</i>
"THE SHELLING HAS STARTED.
"WE'VE LOST
SPECTRA VISION, BERNIE.

"WE HAVE-- I DON'T KNOW
HOW 'BLADE' ENDS.

"WESLEY WAS
FIGHTING THE VAMPIRES,

"AND HE LOOKED LIKE HE WAS DOING
WELL, BUT WHO KNOWS.

"IT'S JUST--
IT'S PURE HELL, BERNIE.

"IT IS PURE-- BLACK IS WHITE,
WHITE IS BLACK-- IT'S CHAOS.

"I ORDERED A SANDWICH,

"I SPECIFICALLY
SAID NO MAYONNAISE,

"THE SANDWICH CAME...
SLATHERED, BERNIE.

"SLATHERED IS
THE ONLY WORD I CAN USE

"FOR THE AMOUNT
OF MAYONNAISE.
"WE SENT IT BACK,
WE'RE PRAYING THAT--

"PLEASE KEEP US IN
YOUR PRAYERS--

"THAT THE SANDWICH WILL
COME BACK WITH NO MAYONNAISE.

"MUSTARD ON THE SIDE, I KNOW,
IS WAY TOO MUCH TO HOPE FOR,

BUT JUST THE NO MAYONNAISE
"WOULD GIVE ME SOME
SEMBLANCE OF SANITY.
"BERNIE, THE SANDWICHES
ARE HERE.
"THEY'RE WHEELING
THE SANDWICHES IN.

"WE'RE GOING TO--

"THERE'S NO MAYONNAISE ON
MY SANDWICH, BERNIE.

"THERE IS
NO MAYONNAISE.

"GOD BLESS AMERICA !
GOD BLESS AMERICA."
IT'S REALLY GREAT TO BE
IN NEW YORK RIGHT NOW.
IT IS, THIS IS
A TERRIFIC CITY.
BUT IT DOES NOT HOLD A CANDLE
TO AMSTERDAM.
I WENT TO
AMSTERDAM LAST YEAR--
HAS ANYONE EVER
BEEN THERE ?
OH, MAN !
I WAS LIKE TEMPLETON THE RAT
IN "CHARLOTTE'S WEB."
JUST RUNNING AROUND,
"OH, HOOKERS AND POT !"
IT WAS UNBELIEVABLE.
AND BEING, LIKE, A TYPICAL
AMERICAN JACKASS,
I DECIDED TO GO
TO THE COFFEE SHOPS
AND GET A LITTLE MARIJUANA,
'CAUSE THAT'S
WHAT AMERICANS DO.
SO, UM-- AND I WAS LIKE
GOLDILOCKS.
I WAS SO SELECTIVE.
"THIS SHOP'S
TOO NEW WAVE.
THIS ONE'S TOO REGGAE."
AND I FOUND
THE PERFECT SHOP.
IT WAS CALLED "THE DOLPHIN,"
ON THE KEIZERSTRAAT.
YOU KNOW HOW I
KNOW IT WAS PERFECT ?
'CAUSE THE MIX TAPE,
WHEN I WENT IN--
SUPERGRASS, ELVIS COSTELLO,
AND THE BEASTIE BOYS.
THE HOLY TRIUMVIRATE !
SO-- NOW, THE STORY
THAT I'M ABOUT TO TELL IS TRUE.

THIS ALL HAPPENED.

AND I WISH IT DIDN'T,
'CAUSE IT SOUNDS FAKE,


BUT THIS ALL HAPPENED THE WAY
I'M ABOUT TO DESCRIBE IT.

IT SOUNDS VERY
ZEMECKIS, BUT IT'S REAL.

AND KEEP IN MIND THAT IT'S
4:30 IN THE AFTERNOON

WHEN THIS HAPPENS,

WHICH MEANT IT WAS 8:30 IN
THE MORNING BACK IN LOS ANGELES.

SO PLEASE KEEP THAT IN MIND.

SO I GO IN, AND I ASK
TO SEE THE POT MENU.

NOW, WHEN YOU GO
INTO THE COFFEE SHOPS

AND YOU WANNA SEE
THE POT MENU,

THEY EITHER BRING OUT
A THREE-RING BINDER

WITH 'EM ALL IN POCKETS,

OR IN THIS CASE, SHE BROUGHT
OUT THIS TACKLE BOX

THAT SHE OPENED
LIKE A FLOWER OF JOY.

AND SO I'M LOOKING
AT ALL THESE,

AND I'M TRYING TO BE
ALL DEREK FLINT, MATT HELM,

INTERNATIONAL COOL.

LIKE, "THE THAI LOOKS
A LITTLE SHAGGY.

I DON'T KNOW."

OF COURSE, INSIDE, I'M LIKE,
"YA-HA-HA-HA, WOO !"

SO FINALLY, I SAY,
"LOOK, I'M NOT GONNA DO ANYTHING

"FOR THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS,

"SO JUST GIVE ME SOMETHING
THAT'S GONNA GET

RIGHT ON TOP
OF MY BOO-BOO."

AND SHE SAID, "YOU WANT
THE WHITE WIDOW

FROM AFGHANISTAN."

SO I GO, "YEAH, I'LL TAKE
THE WHITE WIDOW."

NOW, SHE SHOULD
HAVE WARNED ME, THOUGH.

THE BEST MARIJUANA YOU SMOKE
IN THE UNITED STATES,

YOU MAY AS WELL
BE SMOKING SHOELACES

COMPARED TO THE STUFF
THEY HAVE OVER THERE.

AND THE BUD
SHE SELECTED FOR ME

LEFT ITS PARENTS ON
KRYPTON, ALL RIGHT ?

SO SHE STARTS
MAKING, LIKE, SHE GOES,

"I CAN PUT IT IN A COOKIE,

OR I CAN MAKE TEA,
OR I CAN ROLL YOU A JOINT."

AND I SAID, "YOU CAN
ROLL ME A JOINT."

SO SHE STARTS
ROLLING THIS JOINT--

AND TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF
THE CARE AND CONCERN

AND CRAFTSMANSHIP
THAT WENT INTO MY JOINT--

JUST AS SHE BEGAN ROLLING IT,

QUEEN'S "WE ARE THE CHAMPIONS"
STARTED PLAYING ON THE MIX TAPE.

THAT'S WHAT STARTED PLAYING.

IT TOOK HER THE ENTIRE
SONG TO ROLL IT.
THE ENTIRE SONG !
SHE WAS TAKING OUT
STEMS AND SEEDS.
OH, ROLLING IT SO NICE-- HI !

AND, SO SHE'S, LIKE,
ROLLING IT,

AND THEN SHE STARTS,
LIKE, LICKING IT TO SEAL IT,

LOOKING RIGHT AT ME--

"I... WH... THE...
HOO-HOO..."

AND IT'S 4:30 IN
THE AFTERNOON IN AMSTERDAM,

WHICH MEANT IT WAS 8:30 IN
THE MORNING BACK IN L.A.

IF I HAD KEPT MY
WRITING JOB ON THE SKETCH SHOW

I USED TO BE ON,

I WOULD JUST THEN
BE WAKING UP TO GO IN

AND PITCH SKETCHES THAT I DON'T
WANNA WRITE, LIKE,

"I DON'T KNOW, HOW ABOUT
<i>"'MIDNIGHT IN THE OLIVE GARDEN
OF GOOD AND EVIL ?'</i>

277
00:10:42,294 --> 00:10:43,428
"WHAT ?-- COME ON !"

INSTEAD, I'M IN AMSTERDAM
IN A COFFEE SHOP,

WHERE THIS
BLONDE NORDIC GIANTESS
IS CAREFULLY LICKING
MY JOINT CLOSED,
WHILE QUEEN'S
"WE ARE THE CHAMPIONS"

PLAYS ON THE MIX TAPE.

MY LIFE ROCKED !

FOR A MINUTE !

AND I VISITED
THE ANNE FRANK HOUSE.
IF YOU GO TO AMSTERDAM,
YOU'VE GOT TO GO
TO THE ANNE FRANK HOUSE.
NO, IT WAS
REALLY EMOTIONAL.
IT WAS REALLY SPIRITUAL.
I JUST
COULDN'T BELIEVE IT.
YOU GO IN, AND IT'S
THE ACTUAL HOUSE.
BUT I DIDN'T KNOW THAT YOU
HAD TO PAY TO GET IN.
I THOUGHT YOU JUST--
IT WAS A HISTORICAL--

I THOUGHT YOU JUST GO IN
AND YOU TAKE THE TOUR.

AND THERE'S THIS
BIG BOOTH IN THE LOBBY,

AND I THOUGHT, "WELL, THAT'S
AN INFORMATION BOOTH,"

AND I JUST BREEZED
ON BY, UPSTAIRS I WENT.

WOO !

STARTED TAKING THE TOUR.

SO THE WOMAN DOWNSTAIRS IS LIKE,
"DID THAT GUY JUST NOT PAY ?
HE DIDN'T PAY !"
SO SHE COMES UP
THE STAIRS AFTER ME.
NOW, WHEN I GO TO
OTHER COUNTRIES--
THIS IS GONNA
SOUND KINDA LAME--
BUT I SORTA THINK OF MYSELF
AS AN AMBASSADOR,
INSOFAR AS I DON'T WANNA BE A
TYPICAL AMERICAN DOUCHE NOZZLE,
AND GETTING THROWN OUT OF
THE ANNE FRANK HOUSE--
THAT'S IT.
I MEAN, YOU'VE WON
THE DOUCHE NOZZLE SWEEPSTAKES.
SO SHE'S LOOKING FOR ME,
AND I'M ALREADY ON
THE THIRD FLOOR.
I'M LIKE,
"OH, MAN, WHAT DO I DO ?"
SO I HID BEHIND THIS BOOKCASE
ON THE THIRD FLOOR.
I DIDN'T KNOW
WHERE ELSE TO GO !
SO SHE WAS LOOKING FOR ME FOR,
LIKE, HALF AN HOUR,
SO I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

SO I KEPT THIS DIARY
WHILE I WAS BACK THERE,

'CAUSE I WAS JUST BORED.

I DIDN'T, Y'KNOW, I DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT WAS GONNA HAPPEN.

SO I'D LIKE TO READ AN EXCERPT

FROM THE DIARY THAT
I KEPT WHILE I WAS THERE.

"SATURDAY, JANUARY 10th.
"I DIDN'T KNOW THAT
YOU HAD TO PAY TO GET INTO
"THE ANNE FRANK HOUSE,
"AND NOW I'M HIDING BEHIND A
BOOKCASE ON THE THIRD FLOOR.
"WHEN WILL PEOPLE LEARN
THAT YOU HAVE TO MAKE IT CLEAR
"WHEN YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO PAY TO
GET INTO A HISTORIC LANDMARK
"LIKE THE ANNE FRANK HOUSE,
"SO THAT PEOPLE LIKE ME
NEED NOT LIVE IN FEAR ?
"STILL, I BELIEVE PEOPLE ARE
BASICALLY GOOD,
"AND I HOPE SOMEDAY
TO HAVE A GIRLFRIEND
WHO'LL LET ME FEEL
HER BREASTS."
SO THAT'S JUST AN EXCERPT.
I DIDN'T-- I HAD TO LEAVE MY
DIARY THERE WHEN I FLED,
AND I JUST HOPE THEY PRINT IT
SO PEOPLE CAN LEARN
FROM MY MISTAKE.
SO I'M 30 NOW.
I JUST TURNED 30, AND--

WHICH MEANS I'M
GETTING OLDER.

YOU KNOW WHAT
I'VE REALIZED ?
YOU CAN GROW OLD TWO WAYS.
YOU CAN EITHER GROW OLD IN
WHICH YOU HATE EVERYTHING,
AND YOU'RE JUST,
"YOU KIDS WITH
YOUR ROBOT SERVANTS !"
OR YOU CAN GROW OLD LIKE ME,
IN WHICH YOU LOSE YOUR LOVE
AND HATRED OF EVERYTHING.
YOU KNOW, MY SCALE
OF LOVE AND HATRED
USED TO GO FROM
"OH, YEAH, REALLY ?!
WOO !"
TO "OH, NO WAY,
OH, GET-- NO !"
NOW THE SCALE GOES--
HERE'S MY SCALE.
READY ?
"OH, THAT'S...
MM-HMM."
TO "OH, EH, NO."
YEAH, I DON'T KNOW...
OKAY, THAT'S RIGHT.
SO... REMEMBER WHEN
YOU WERE GROWING UP
AND YOU WANTED TO COLOR
EGGS FOR EASTER ?
WHERE DID YOU GO ?
THERE WAS ONLY
ONE GAME IN TOWN.
<i>PAAS.</i>

<i>YOU WENT PAAS,
OR YOU WENT TO HELL !</i>

REMEMBER THAT ?

THAT WAS ON
THE BOX.

'CAUSE THEY
HAD THE MONOPOLY.

THEY COULD SAY THAT.

REMEMBER WHEN YOU
GOT THE KIT ?

WHAT DID YOU GET ?

YOU GOT THE LITTLE COLOR
TABLETS-- REMEMBER THOSE ?

AND YOU PUT 'EM IN THE WATER

AND THE WATER WOULD SMELL
LIKE A VINEGAR FART,

AND THEN YOU
WOULD TAKE THE EGG
AND PUT THE EGG IN
THE LITTLE WIRE SEAT--

REMEMBER THAT, THAT LITTLE
TORTURE SEAT ?

"I'LL LOWER YOU
TO YOUR DOOM !

SCREAM ALL YOU WANT !"

OR, LIKE ME, YOU'D PUT ALL
THE TABLETS INTO ONE GLASS,

AND THAT WOULD TURN
THE EGGS BROWN.
"OH, CAN'T GET
BROWN EGGS, PATTON.

THAT'S OUR LITTLE PRODIGY."

THEN YOU COULD PUNCH OUT
THE BACK OF THE BOX--

REMEMBER THAT--
AND MAKE A LITTLE EGG HOLDER.

OH, REMEMBER THAT ?

BUT, LIKE ME, YOU WOULDN'T
WAIT FOR THE EGGS TO DRY,

AND THEN THE BOX WOULD DISSOLVE,

AND YOUR DAD WOULD
START DRINKING--

THAT'S NOT IMPORTANT.

WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS THAT THAT
IS ALL THE KIT CAME WITH.

BUT THEN REMEMBER IN THE '70s

ALL THOSE UPSTART
COMPANIES CAME ALONG,

<i>TRYING TO UNSEAT THE PAAS
DYNASTY ?!</i>
THERE WAS
"SHAKE AN EGG"--

REMEMBER "SHAKE AN EGG" ?
YOU PUT THE EGG
IN THE BAG WITH THE GLITTER

AND IT CAME OUT LOOKING
ALL GLAM ROCKY,

LIKE IT FELL OUT
OF DAVID BOWIE'S ASS ?

"HEY, LOOK, HAPPY EASTER !

BANG A GONG,
EVERYBODY !"

<i>AND THEN RONCO CAME OUT WITH
THAT WEIRD INQUISITION CLAMP.</i>


REMEMBER THAT ?
YOU'D PUT
THE EGG IN THE CLAMP,

AND THEN YOU'D PUT THE MAGIC
MARKER AND A CLAMP HERE,

AND THEN YOU'D
TURN THE EGG ALL...
"OH, A LINE !

"THERE'S A LINE
ON THE EGG !
IT'S 4:00 IN THE MORNING."

I WENT BACK IN
THE DRUGSTORE RECENTLY,

LOOKING FOR EGG COLORING KITS--

THERE'S ONLY ONE
COMPANY STANDING.
<i>PAAS, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.</i>

<i>PAAS !</i>

AND WHEN YOU GET THE KIT--

YOU BUY THAT KIT,
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU GET ?

YOU GET FIVE COLORED TABLETS,
A LITTLE WIRE THING, A PUNCH--

THEY DIDN'T CHANGE A THING !

WHAT CHROME-PLATED BALLS
ON THOSE GUYS.

THEY DIDN'T--
I JUST IMAGINE THEIR FOUNDER,

SOME GUY NAMED HENRY PAAS,
GOING,
"LET 'EM GO TO THEIR
LITTLE "SHAKE AN EGGS"

<i>"OR THEIR RONCO THINGS.</i>

"THEY'LL COME
CRAWLING BACK.

<i>"WE'RE PAAS.</i>

"MY FATHER STARTED THIS COMPANY
WITH ONE COLOR TABLET,

"AND IT WAS WHITE,
AND WE WERE THANKFUL !

<i>"PAAS !</i>

"HAPPY EASTER, AND BITE
MY WRINKLY BALL SACK.

PUT THAT ON THE BOX !"

CAN WE SAY
"BITE MY WRINKLY BALL SACK ?"

WELL, I GUESS
WE'RE GONNA FIND OUT.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
I LOVE HOW TV
IS SO GOOD RIGHT NOW.

THERE'S A LOT OF REALLY
GOOD SHOWS ON TV.

AND WHAT'S GREAT ABOUT ALL
THESE GOOD SHOWS BEING ON TV
IS IT MAKES THE BAD SHOWS LOOK
LIKE AN INFECTED 'RHOID--

LIKE THEY REALLY STAND OUT.

<i>FOR INSTANCE, ESPECIALLY,
LIKE, TFOX NETWORK</i>

IS STARTING TO
REALIZE THAT, YOU KNOW,

<i>"EXCEPT FTHE SIMPSONS
AND THE X-FILES</i>

<i>AND KING OF THE HILL
OUR NETWORK SORTA SUCKS."</i>

SO THEY'RE STARTING TO SHOW
JUST VIDEOS OF THINGS LIKE
"WORLD'S SCARIEST
POLICE CHASES,"
AND "WHEN THINGS GO WRONG."
AND THEY SHOW A GUY
IN A PARACHUTE.
"AAAAH !"
JUST FALLING.
IT'S ALWAYS
THE SAME GUY.
"AAAAAH !"

AND THAT'S COOL.

I'LL WATCH
THOSE SHOWS.

BUT THEN RECENTLY THEY REALLY
HIT THE BOTTOM OF THE BARREL,

451
BECAUSE THEY SHOWED A SHOW

<i>CALLED    "FOX'S MOST SHOCKING
MEDICAL VIDEOS."</i>
ANYONE SEE THIS SHOW ?

"MOST SHOCKING
MEDICAL VIDEOS."

OKAY, A COUPLE THINGS.

NUMBER ONE, ALL MEDICAL
VIDEOS ARE SHOCKING !

THEY'RE MEDICAL VIDEOS,
FOR GOD'S SAKES.

THERE'S NO
SOOTHING MEDICAL VIDEOS.

THERE'S NOTHING LIKE,
"WELL, THE STUFFING'S
TAKING FOREVER,
"SO LET'S WATCH THIS
EPISIOTOMY FOOTAGE THAT I HAVE.

"WHEN THE BONE SAW HITS
THE LIGAMENTS,

IT'S A SYMPHONY."

THE OTHER THING IS,
DURING THE WHOLE SPECIAL,

THEY KEPT TRYING
TO SHOW YOU--

THEY KEPT TRYING TO TELL YOU,

"WELL, YOU'RE GONNA LEARN
SOMETHING ABOUT MEDICAL SCIENCE.
"THIS IS A VERY
EDUCATIONAL SHOW,
AND YOU'LL LEARN ABOUT
THE WONDERS OF SCIENCE."
NO, NO.

THIS IS ALL WET-ASS
HOUR SURGERY,

WHEN THE BOTTOM HAS
FALLEN THROUGH THE BASEMENT,

AND SOME GUY COMES IN WITH
AN ELK'S LEG UP HIS ASS,
AND THE DOCTOR'S LIKE,
"AHH, AH...

"AH, I DON'T HAVE...

"THERE'S NO ELK/ASS CHAPTER
OF THE GRAY'S ANATOMY.

"GET SOME TONGS
AND... SOME BUTTER.
"I DON'T KNOW.

I DIDN'T
TRAIN FOR THIS."
I THINK THE BOTTOM MOMENT
OF THE SPECIAL CAME

WHEN THIS GUY--
THERE WAS A GUY THAT
WENT UP IN THE HIMALAYAS,

AND HE GOT EXTREME FROSTBITE,
AND HIS FACE TURNED BLACK,

AND THEN...
FELL OFF !

HIS FACE FELL OFF !
SO THE DOCTORS ARE
RECONSTRUCTING HIS FACE,

AND NOW HE'S
GOT NO NOSE.

SO HE HAS OPTIONS.

OH, HE'S GOT
OPTIONS NOW.

OPTION NUMBER ONE IS TO GET
THIS FAKE CLIP-ON NOSE.
IT'S A FAKE HARD PLASTIC NOSE,

AND THEY PUT THESE METAL STUDS,
AND YOU CLIP IT ON.
AND THEY SHOW
A GUY WITH NO NOSE,

AND THE GUY CLIPS IT ON,
AND HE LOOKED OKAY.

HE LOOKED LIKE--
HE LOOKED FINE.

BUT THIS GUY SAID,
"OH, PHOOEY AND PSHAW.

"NO FAKE NOSE
FOR ME.

"THAT'S ALL FLUMMERY.
I WANT
SOMETHING REAL."

SO THE DOCTORS CONSULT THIS
ANCIENT SANSKRIT MEDICAL TEXT.

WHY THEY ARE CONSULTING

AN ANCIENT SANSKRIT
MEDICAL TEXT--

BEYOND ME.
BUT THERE'S A WAY
THEY CAN TAKE SKIN AND FAT

FROM OTHER PARTS OF YOUR BODY
AND GROW APPENDAGES.

SO THEY MAKE A NOSE OUT OF,
LIKE, ASS FAT AND THIGH SKIN,

AND THEY GROW IT UPSIDE
DOWN ON HIS FOREHEAD.

SO FOR A YEAR,
HE HAS A HOLE IN HIS FACE,

AND AN UPSIDE-DOWN NOSE.

AAGH !

GO INTO RESTAURANTS,
CATCHING A FLICK--

OH MY GOD !
THEN THEY TAKE
THE ASS-FAT NOSE,

SEW IT OVER THE NOSE HOLE,

AND THEY SHOW HIM WITH HIS NEW,
NATURAL-LOOKING NOSE.
AND IT LOOKED HORRIFYING.

OH MY GOD, IF MY
FACE EVER FELL OFF,

I WOULD HAVE THE PRESENCE
OF MIND TO KILL MYSELF.
I WOULD NOT HANG AROUND,
MR. SOPPY GOBFACE,
CLINGING ON TO LIFE.
( grumbling )
"OH MY GOD, WHAT'S WRONG
WITH HIM ?"
"HE LOVES LIFE,
HE WON'T LET GO."
( grumbling )
"OH GOD,
PLEASE KILL YOURSELF !"
THANK YOU VERY MUCH,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
GOOD NIGHT.
